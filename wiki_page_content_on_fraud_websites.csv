"Click fraud is a type of ad fraud that occurs on the Internet in pay per click (PPC) online advertising. In this type of advertising, the owners of websites that post the ads are paid based on how many site visitors click on the ads. Fraud occurs when a person, automated script, computer program or an auto clicker imitates a legitimate user of a web browser, clicking on such an ad without having an actual interest in the target of the ad's link in order to increase revenue. Click fraud is the subject of some controversy and increasing litigation due to the advertising networks being a key beneficiary of the fraud.
Media entrepreneur and journalist John Battelle describes click fraud as the intentionally malicious, ""decidedly black hat"" practice of publishers gaming paid search advertising by employing robots or low-wage workers to click on ads on their sites repeatedly, thereby generating money to be paid by the advertiser to the publisher and to any agent the advertiser may be using. 


== Pay-per-click advertising ==

PPC advertising is an arrangement in which webmasters (operators of websites), acting as publishers, display clickable links from advertisers in exchange for a charge per click. As this industry evolved, a number of advertising networks developed, which acted as middlemen between these two groups (publishers and advertisers). Each time a (believed to be) valid Web user clicks on an ad, the advertiser pays the advertising network, which in turn pays the publisher a share of this money. This revenue-sharing system is seen as an incentive for click fraud.
The largest of the advertising networks, Google's AdWords/AdSense and Yahoo! Search Marketing, act in a dual role, since they are also publishers themselves (on their search engines). According to critics, this complex relationship may create a conflict of interest. This is because these companies lose money to undetected click fraud when paying out to the publisher but make more money when collecting fees from the advertiser. Because of the spread between what they collect and pay out, unfettered click fraud would create short-term profits for these companies.


== Non-contracting parties ==

A secondary source of click fraud is non-contracting parties, who are not part of any pay-per-click agreement. This type of fraud is even harder to police, because perpetrators generally cannot be sued for breach of contract or charged criminally with fraud. Examples of non-contracting parties are:

Competitors of advertisers: These parties may wish to harm a competitor who advertises in the same market by clicking on their ads. The perpetrators do not profit directly but force the advertiser to pay for irrelevant clicks, thus weakening or eliminating a source of competition.
Competitors of publishers: These persons may wish to frame a publisher. It is made to look as if the publisher is clicking on its own ads. The advertising network may then terminate the relationship. Many publishers rely exclusively on revenue from advertising and could be put out of business by such an attack.
Other malicious intent: As with vandalism, there are many motives for wishing to cause harm to either an advertiser or a publisher, even by people who have nothing to gain financially. Motives include political and personal vendettas. These cases are often the hardest to deal with, since it is difficult to track down the culprit, and if found, there is little legal action that can be taken against them.
Friends of the publisher: Sometimes upon learning a publisher profits from ads being clicked, a supporter of the publisher (like a fan, family member, political party supporter, charity patron or personal friend) will click on the ads to help. This can be considered patronage. However, this can backfire when the publisher (not the friend) is accused of click fraud.
Advertising networks may try to stop fraud by all parties but often do not know which clicks are legitimate. Unlike fraud committed by the publisher, it is difficult to know who should pay when past click fraud is found. Publishers resent having to pay refunds for something that is not their fault. However, advertisers are adamant that they should not have to pay for phony clicks.


== Organization ==
Click fraud can be as simple as one person starting a small Web site, becoming a publisher of ads, and clicking on those ads to generate revenue. Often the number of clicks and their value is so small that the fraud goes undetected. Publishers may claim that small amounts of such clicking is an accident, which is often the case.
Much larger-scale fraud also occurs in cybercrime communities. According to Jean-Loup Richet, Professor at the Sorbonne Business School, click fraud is frequently one link in the large ad fraud chain, and can be leveraged as part of a larger identity fraud and/or attribution fraud.  Those engaged in large-scale fraud will often run scripts which simulate a human clicking on ads in Web pages. 
However, huge numbers of clicks appearing to come from just one, or a small number of computers, or a single geographic area, look highly suspicious to the advertising network and advertisers.
Clicks coming from a computer known to be that of a publisher also look suspicious to those watching for click fraud. A person attempting large-scale fraud, from one computer, stands a good chance of being caught.
One type of fraud that circumvents detection based on IP patterns uses existing user traffic, turning this into clicks or impressions. Such an attack can be camouflaged from users by using 0-size iframes to display advertisements that are programmatically retrieved using JavaScript. It could also be camouflaged from advertisers and portals by ensuring that so-called ""reverse spiders"" are presented with a legitimate page, while human visitors are presented with a page that commits click fraud. The use of 0-size iframes and other techniques involving human visitors may also be combined with the use of incentivized traffic, where members of ""Paid to Read"" (PTR) sites are paid small amounts of money (often a fraction of a cent) to visit a website and/or click on keywords and search results, sometimes hundreds or thousands of times every day Some owners of PTR sites are members of PPC engines and may send many email ads to users who do search, while sending few ads to those who do not.  They do this mainly because the charge per click on search results is often the only source of revenue to the site.  This is known as forced searching, a practice that is frowned upon in the Get Paid To industry.
Organized crime can handle this by having many computers with their own Internet connections in different geographic locations. Often, scripts fail to mimic true human behavior, so organized crime networks use Trojan code to turn the average person's machines into zombie computers and use sporadic redirects or DNS cache poisoning to turn the oblivious user's actions into actions generating revenue for the scammer. It can be difficult for advertisers, advertising networks, and authorities to pursue cases against networks of people spread around multiple countries.
Impression fraud is when falsely generated ad impressions affect an advertiser's account. In the case of click-through rate based auction models, the advertiser may be penalized for having an unacceptably low click-through for a given keyword. This involves making numerous searches for a keyword without clicking of the ad. Such ads are disabled automatically, enabling a competitor's lower-bid ad for the same keyword to continue, while several high bidders (on the first page of the search results) have been eliminated.


=== Hit inflation attack ===
A hit inflation attack is a kind of fraudulent method used by some advertisement publishers to earn unjustified revenue on the traffic they drive to the advertisers’ Web sites. It is more sophisticated and harder to detect than a simple inflation attack.
This process involves the collaboration of two counterparts, a dishonest publisher, P, and a dishonest Web site, S.
Web pages on S contain a script that redirects the customer to P's Web site, and this process is hidden from the customer. So, when user U retrieves a page on S, it would simulate a click or request to a page on P's site. P's site has two kinds of webpages: a manipulated version, and an original version. The manipulated version simulates a click or request to the advertisement, causing P to be credited for the click-through. P selectively determines whether to load the manipulated (and thus fraudulent) script to U's browser by checking if it was from S. This can be done through the Referrer field, which specifies the site from which the link to P was obtained. All requests from S will be loaded with the manipulated script, and thus the automatic and hidden request will be sent.
This attack will silently convert every innocent visit to S to a click on the advertisement on P's page. Even worse, P can be in collaboration with several dishonest Web sites, each of which can be in collaboration with several dishonest publishers. If the advertisement commissioner visits the Web site of P, the non-fraudulent page will be displayed, and thus P cannot be accused of being fraudulent. Without a reason for suspecting that such collaboration exists, the advertisement commissioner has to inspect all the Internet sites to detect such attacks, which is infeasible.
Another proposed method for detection of this type of fraud is through use of association rules.


== Manipulation of organic search results ==
One major factor that affects the ranking of websites in organic search results is the CTR (Click-through Rate). That is the ratio of clicks to impressions, or in other words how many times a search result is clicked on, as compared to the number of times the listing appears in search results.
In contrast to PPC fraud, where a competitor leverages the services of a botnet, or low-cost labour, to generate false clicks, in this case the objective is to adopt a ""beggar thy neighbour"" policy against competitors by making their CTR rate as low as possible, thereby diminishing their position in search results.
Bad actors will therefore generate false clicks on organic search results that they wish to promote, while avoiding search results they wish to demote. This technique can effectively create a cartel of business services controlled by the same bad actor, or be used to promote a certain political opinion etc. The scale of this issue is unknown but is certainly evident to many website developers who pay close attention to the statistics in webmaster tools.


== Legal cases ==


=== Lawsuits ===
Disputes over the issue have resulted in a number of lawsuits. In one case, Google (acting as both an advertiser and advertising network) won a lawsuit against a Texas company called Auction Experts (acting as a publisher), which Google accused of paying people to click on ads that appeared on Auction Experts' site, costing advertisers $50,000.  Despite networks' efforts to stop it, publishers are suspicious of the motives of the advertising networks, because the advertising network receives money for each click, even if it is fraudulent.
In July 2005, Yahoo settled a class action lawsuit against it by plaintiffs alleging it did not do enough to prevent click fraud. Yahoo paid $4.5 million in legal bills for the plaintiffs and agreed to settle advertiser claims dating back to 2004  In July 2006, Google settled a similar suit for $90 million.
On March 8, 2006, Google agreed to a $90 million settlement fund in the class-action lawsuit filed by Lane's Gifts & Collectibles.  The class-action lawsuit was filed in Miller County, Arkansas, by Dallas attorneys Steve Malouf, Joel Fineberg, and Dean Gresham.   The expert witness for the Plaintiffs in the case was Jessie Stricchiola, an internet search expert who first identified instances of PPC fraud in 2001.


=== Michael Anthony Bradley ===
In 2004, California resident Michael Anthony Bradley created Google Clique, a software program that he claimed could let spammers defraud Google out of millions of dollars in fraudulent clicks, which ultimately led to his arrest and indictment.
Bradley was able to demonstrate that fraud was possible, and was impossible for Google to detect. The Department of Justice alleged that he contacted Google saying that unless they paid him $100,000 for the rights to the technology, he would sell it to spammers, costing Google millions. As a result, Bradley was arrested for extortion and mail fraud in 2006.
Charges were dropped without explanation on November 22, 2006; both the US Attorney's office and Google declined to comment. Business Week suggests that Google was unwilling to cooperate with the prosecution, as it would be forced to disclose its click fraud detection techniques publicly.


=== Fabio Gasperini ===
On June 18, 2016, Fabio Gasperini, an Italian citizen, was extradited to the United States on click fraud charges. An indictment charged Gasperini with:

two counts of computer intrusion
one count of wire fraud
one count of wire fraud conspiracy
and one count of money laundering
According to the U.S. government, Gasperini set up and operated a botnet of over 140,000 computers around the world. This was the first click fraud trial in the United States. If convicted of all counts, Gasperini risked up to 70 years in prison.
Simone Bertollini, an Italian-American lawyer, represented Gasperini at trial. On August 9, 2017 a jury acquitted Gasperini of all the felony charges of the indictment. Gasperini was convicted of one misdemeanor count of obtaining information without a financial gain. Gasperini was sentenced to the statutory maximum of one year imprisonment, a $100,000 fine, and one year of supervised release following incarceration. Shortly after he was credited with time served and sent back to Italy. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling on July 2, 2018.


== Solutions ==
Proving click fraud can be very difficult since it is hard to know who is behind a computer and what their intentions are. When it comes to mobile ad fraud detection, data analysis can give some reliable indications. Abnormal metrics can hint at the presence of different types of frauds. To detect click fraud in the ad campaign, advertisers can focus on the following attribution points:

IP Address: As bots run similar scripts from the same server, any click fraud on mobile ads will indicate a high density of clicks coming from the same IP address or a range of similar IP addresses. Advertisers can also run check on IP addresses to verify their history with another fraud.
Click Timestamp: Click timestamp maintains the time at which the click is made on the ad. The bot-based click fraud runs repeatedly to attempt clicking on the ads, which increases click frequency for that duration. A high range of clicks with almost similar timestamp points at the possibility of click fraud. A low duration and high frequency mean a high probability of fraud.
Action Timestamp: Action timestamp is the time at which the user takes action on (or engages with) the app or website. With a bot-based click attack, there can be a similarity with action timestamp. As bot clicks on the advertisement and then performs the action on app or website without any delay, the advertiser can notice a low or almost no action timestamp.
Often the best an advertising network can do is to identify which clicks are most likely fraudulent and not charge the account of the advertiser. Even more sophisticated means of detection are used, but none are foolproof.
The Tuzhilin Report produced by Alexander Tuzhilin as part of a click fraud lawsuit settlement, has a detailed and comprehensive discussion of these issues.  In particular, it defines ""the Fundamental Problem of invalid (fraudulent) clicks"":

""There is no conceptual definition of invalid clicks that can be operationalized [except for certain obviously clear cases].""
""An operational definition cannot be fully disclosed to the general public because of the concerns that unethical users will take advantage of it, which may lead to a massive click fraud. However, if it is not disclosed, advertisers cannot verify or even dispute why they have been charged for certain clicks.""
The PPC industry is lobbying for tighter laws on the issue. Many hope to have laws that will cover those not bound by contracts.
A number of companies are developing viable solutions for click fraud identification and are developing intermediary relationships with advertising networks. Such solutions fall into two categories:

Forensic analysis of advertisers' web server log files.This analysis of the advertiser's web server data requires an in-depth look at the source and behavior of the traffic. As industry standard log files are used for the analysis, the data is verifiable by advertising networks. The problem with this approach is that it relies on the honesty of the middlemen in identifying fraud.
Third-party corroboration.Third parties offer web-based solutions that might involve placement of single-pixel images or Javascript on the advertiser's web pages and suitable tagging of the ads. The visitor may be presented with a cookie. Visitor information is then collected in a third-party data store and made available for download. The better offerings make it easy to highlight suspicious clicks, and they show the reasons for such a conclusion. Since an advertiser's log files can be tampered with, their accompaniment with corroborating data from a third-party forms a more convincing body of evidence to present to the advertising network. However, the problem with third-party solutions is that such solutions see only part of the traffic of the entire network. Hence, they can be less likely to identify patterns that span several advertisers. In addition, due to the limited amount of traffic they receive when compared to middlemen, they can be overly or less aggressive when judging traffic to be fraud.
In a 2007 interview in Forbes, Google click fraud prevention expert Shuman Ghosemajumder said that one of the key challenges in click fraud detection by third-parties was access to data beyond clicks, notably, ad impression data.
Click fraud is less likely in cost per action models.


== Research ==
The fact that the middlemen (search engines) have the upper hand in the operational definition of invalid clicks is the reason for the conflict of interest between advertisers and the middlemen, as described above. This is manifested in the Tuzhilin Report as described above. The Tuzhilin report did not publicly define invalid clicks and did not describe the operational definitions in detail. Rather, it gave a high-level picture of the fraud-detection system and argued that the operational definition of the search engine under investigations is ""reasonable"". One aim of the report was to preserve the privacy of the fraud-detection system in order to maintain its effectiveness. This prompted some researchers to conduct public research on how the middlemen can fight click fraud. Since such research is presumably not tainted by market forces, there is hope that this research can be adopted to assess how rigorous a middleman is in detecting click fraud in future law cases. The fear that this research can expose the internal fraud-detection system of middlemen still applies. An example of such research is that done by Metwally, Agrawal and El Abbadi at UCSB.  Other work by Majumdar, Kulkarni, and Ravishankar at UC Riverside proposes protocols for the identification of fraudulent behavior by brokers and other intermediaries in content-delivery networks.

"Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card. The purpose may be to obtain goods or services or to make payment to another account, which is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the data security standard created to help financial institutions process card payments securely and reduce card fraud.
Credit card fraud can be authorised, where the genuine customer themselves processes payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal, or unauthorised, where the account holder does not provide authorisation for the payment to proceed and the transaction is carried out by a third party. In 2018, unauthorised financial fraud losses across payment cards and remote banking totalled £844.8 million in the United Kingdom. Whereas banks and card companies prevented £1.66 billion in unauthorised fraud in 2018. That is the equivalent to £2 in every £3 of attempted fraud being stopped.
Credit card fraud can occur when unauthorized users gain access to an individual's credit card information in order to make purchases, other transactions, or open new accounts. A few examples of credit card fraud include account takeover fraud, new account fraud, cloned cards, and cards-not-present schemes. This unauthorized access occurs through phishing, skimming, and information sharing by a user, oftentimes unknowingly. However, this type of fraud can be detected through means of artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as prevented by issuers, institutions, and individual cardholders. According to a 2021 annual report, about 50% of all Americans have experienced a fraudulent charge on their credit or debit cards, and more than one in three credit or debit card holders have experienced fraud multiple times. This amounts to 127 million people in the US that have been victims of credit card theft at least once.
Regulators, card providers and banks take considerable time and effort to collaborate with investigators worldwide with the goal of ensuring fraudsters are not successful. Cardholders' money is usually protected from scammers with regulations that make the card provider and bank accountable. The technology and security measures behind credit cards are continuously advancing, adding barriers for fraudsters attempting to steal money.


== Means of payment card fraud ==
There are two kinds of card fraud: card-present fraud (not so common nowadays) and card-not-present fraud (more common). The compromise can occur in a number of ways and can usually occur without the knowledge of the cardholder. The internet has made database security lapses particularly costly, in some cases, millions of accounts have been compromised.
Stolen cards can be reported quickly by cardholders, but a compromised account's details may be held by a fraudster for months before any theft, making it difficult to identify the source of the compromise. The cardholder may not discover fraudulent use until receiving a statement. Cardholders can mitigate this fraud risk by checking their account frequently to ensure there are not any suspicious or unknown transactions.
When a credit card is lost or stolen, it may be used for illegal purchases until the holder notifies the issuing bank and the bank puts a block on the account. Most banks have free 24-hour telephone numbers to encourage prompt reporting. Still, it is possible for a thief to make unauthorized purchases on a card before the card is cancelled.


== Prevention of payment card fraud ==
Card information is stored in a number of formats. Card numbers – formally the Primary Account Number (PAN) – are often embossed or imprinted on the card, and a magnetic stripe on the back contains the data in a machine-readable format. Fields can vary, but the most common include the Name of the cardholder; Card number; Expiration date; and Verification CVV code.
In Europe and Canada, most cards are equipped with an EMV chip which requires a 4 to 6 digit PIN to be entered into the merchant's terminal before payment will be authorized. However, a PIN is not required for online transactions. In some European countries, buyers using a card without a chip may be asked for photo ID at the point of sale.
In some countries, a credit card holder can make a contactless payment for goods or services by tapping their card against a RFID or NFC reader without the need for a PIN or signature if the cost falls under a pre-determined limit. However, a stolen credit or debit card could be used for a number of smaller transactions prior to the fraudulent activity being flagged.
Card issuers maintain several countermeasures, including software that can estimate the probability of fraud. For example, a large transaction occurring a great distance from the cardholder's home might seem suspicious. The merchant may be instructed to call the card issuer for verification or to decline the transaction, or even to hold the card and refuse to return it to the customer.


== Detecting credit card fraud using technology ==


=== Artificial and Computational intelligence ===
Given the immense difficulty of detecting credit card fraud, artificial and computational intelligence was developed in order to make machines attempt tasks in which humans are already doing well. Computation intelligence is simply a subset of AI enabling intelligence in a changing environment. Due to advances in both artificial and computational intelligence, the most commonly used and suggested ways to detect credit card fraud are rule induction techniques, decision trees, neural networks, Support Vector Machines, logistic regression, and meta heuristics. There are many different approaches that may be used to detect credit card fraud. For example, some ""suggest a framework which can be applied real time where first an outlier analysis is made separately for each customer using self-organizing maps and then a predictive algorithm is utilized to classify the abnormal looking transactions."" Some problems that arise when detecting credit card fraud through computational intelligence is the idea of misclassifications such as false negatives/positives, as well as detecting fraud on a credit card having a larger available limit is much more prominent than detecting a fraud with a smaller available limit. One algorithm that helps detect these sorts of issues is determined as the MBO Algorithm. This is a search technique that brings upon improvement by its ""neighbor solutions"". Another algorithm that assists with these issues is the GASS algorithm. In GASS, it is a hybrid of genetic algorithms and a scatter search.


=== Machine learning ===
Touching a little more on the difficulties of credit card fraud detection, even with more advances in learning and technology every day, companies refuse to share their algorithms and techniques to outsiders. Additionally, fraud transactions are only about 0.01–0.05% of daily transactions, making it even more difficult to spot. Machine learning is similar to artificial intelligence where it is a sub field of AI where statistics is a subdivision of mathematics.  With regards to machine learning, the goal is to find a model that yields that highest level without overfitting at the same time. Overfitting means that the computer system memorized the data and if a new transaction differs in the training set in any way, it will most likely be misclassified, leading to an irritated cardholder or a victim of fraud that was not detected. The most popular programming used in machine learning are Python, R, and MatLab. At the same time, SAS is becoming an increasing competitor as well. Through these programs, the easiest method used in this industry is the Support Vector Machine. R has a package with the SVM function already programmed into it. When Support Vector Machines are employed, it is an efficient way to extract data. SVM is considered active research and successfully solves classification issues as well. Playing a major role in machine learning, it has ""excellent generalization performance in a wide range of learning problems, such as handwritten digit recognition, classification of web pages and face detection."" SVM is also a successful method because it lowers the possibility of overfitting and dimensionality.


== Types of payment card fraud ==


=== Application fraud ===
Application fraud takes place when a person uses stolen or fake documents to open an account in another person's name. Criminals may steal or fake documents such as utility bills and bank statements to build up a personal profile. When an account is opened using fake or stolen documents, the fraudster could then withdraw cash or obtain credit in the victim's name.
Application fraud can also occur using a synthetic identity which is similar to the fake documents mentioned above. A synthetic identity is personal information gathered from many different identities to create one fake identity. Once the identity and the account is established, the fraudster has a few different options to take advantage of the bank.  They can maximize their credit card spending by spending as much money as possible on their new credit card. Many fraudsters will use the new credit card to purchase items that have a high resale value so they can turn it into cash.


=== Account takeover ===
An account takeover refers to the act by which fraudsters will attempt to assume control of a customer's account (i.e. credit cards, email, banks, SIM card and more).  Control at the account level offers high returns for fraudsters. According to Forrester, risk-based authentication (RBA) plays a key role in risk mitigation.
A fraudster uses parts of the victim's identity such as an email address to gain access to financial accounts. This individual then intercepts communication about the account to keep the victim blind to any threats. Victims are often the first to detect account takeover when they discover charges on monthly statements they did not authorize or multiple questionable withdrawals. There has been an increase in the number of account takeovers since the adoption of EMV technology, which makes it more difficult for fraudsters to clone physical credit cards.
Among some of the most common methods by which a fraudster will commit an account, takeover includes proxy-based ""checker"" one-click apps, brute-force botnet attacks, phishing, and malware. Other methods include dumpster diving to find personal information in discarded mail, and outright buying lists of 'Fullz', a slang term for full packages of identifying information sold on the black market.
Once logged in, fraudsters have access to the account and can make purchases and withdraw money from bank accounts. They have access to any information that is tied to the account and can steal credit card numbers along with social security numbers. They can change the passwords to prevent the victim from accessing their account. Cybercriminals have the opportunity to open other accounts, utilize rewards and benefits from the account, and sell this information to other hackers.


=== Social engineering fraud ===
Social engineering fraud can occur when a criminal poses as someone else which results in a voluntary transfer of money or information to the fraudster. Fraudsters are turning to more sophisticated methods of scamming people and businesses out of money. A common tactic is sending spoof emails impersonating a senior member of staff and trying to deceive employees into transferring money to a fraudulent bank account.
Fraudsters may use a variety of techniques in order to solicit personal information by pretending to be a bank or payment processor. Telephone phishing is the most common social engineering technique to gain the trust of the victim.
Businesses can protect themselves with a dual authorisation process for the transfer of funds that requires authorisation from at least two persons, and a call-back procedure to a previously established contact number, rather than any contact information included with the payment request. The bank must refund any unauthorised payment; however, they can refuse a refund if they can prove the customer authorised the transaction, or it can prove the customer is at fault because they acted deliberately, or failed to protect details that allowed the transaction.


=== Skimming ===

Skimming is the theft of personal information which has been used in an otherwise normal transaction. The thief can procure a victim's card number using basic methods such as photocopying receipts or more advanced methods such as using a small electronic device (skimmer) to swipe and store hundreds of victims' card numbers. Common scenarios for skimming are taxis, restaurants or bars where the skimmer has possession of the victim's payment card out of their immediate view. The thief may also use a small keypad to unobtrusively transcribe the three or four-digit card security code, which is not present on the magnetic strip.
Call centers are another area where skimming can easily occur. Skimming can also occur at merchants when a third-party card-reading device is installed outside a card-swiping terminal. This device allows a thief to capture a customer's card information, including their PIN, with each card swipe.
Skimming is difficult for the typical cardholder to detect, but given a large enough sample, it is fairly easy for the card issuer to detect. The issuer collects a list of all the cardholders who have complained about fraudulent transactions, and then uses data mining to discover relationships among them and the merchants they use. Sophisticated algorithms can also search for patterns of fraud. Merchants must ensure the physical security of their terminals, and penalties for merchants can be severe if they are compromised, ranging from large fines by the issuer to complete exclusion from the system, which can be a death blow to businesses such as restaurants where credit card transactions are the norm.
Instances of skimming have been reported where the perpetrator has put over the card slot of an automated teller machine, a device that reads the magnetic strip as the user unknowingly passes their card through it. These devices are often used in conjunction with a miniature camera to read the user's personal identification number at the same time. This method has been used in many parts of the world including South America and Europe.


=== Unexpected repeat billing ===
Online bill paying and internet purchases utilizing a bank account are sources of repeat billing known as ""recurring bank charges"". These are standing orders or banker's orders from a customer to honour and pay a certain amount every month to the payee. With e-commerce, especially in the United States, a vendor or payee can receive payment by direct debit through the ACH Network. While many payments or purchases are valid, and the customer has intentions to pay the bill monthly, some are known as rogue automatic payments.
Another type of credit card fraud targets utility customers. Customers receive unsolicited in-person, telephone, or electronic communication from individuals claiming to be representatives of utility companies. The scammers alert customers that their utilities will be disconnected unless an immediate payment is made, usually involving the use of a reloadable debit card to receive payment. Sometimes the scammers use authentic-looking phone numbers and graphics to deceive victims.


=== Phishing ===
Phishing is one of the most common methods used to steal personal data. It is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker acts as a credible person, institution, or entity and attempts to lure the victim into accepting a message or taking action with the specific request. Often, the target of the attack will receive an email or text message about something they would possibly want or need with the hope of tricking them into opening or downloading the message. Phishing increased uring the COVID-19 pandemic as the world relied more on electronic communications, with researchers noting ""a substantial spike of 667%"" in phishing attacks during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic alone. Moreover, given the significance of health care systems over recent years, health care companies have been main targets of phishing attacks. Such companies possess huge amounts of patient personal data that can be extremely valuable to an attacker.


=== Information sharing ===

Information sharing is the transfer or exchange of data between individuals, companies, organizations, and technologies. Advances in technology, the internet, and networks have accelerated the growth of information sharing. Information can be transmitted and treated at speeds faster than ever before.
Individuals may lack a sense of how much sensitive personal information they may themselves share on a given day. For example, when purchasing goods online, an individual provides their name, email address, home address, and credit card information, all of which may be stored and shared with third parties for purposes of tracking the individual's future purchases. Organizations may go to lengths to keep individuals' personal information secure in their databases, but historically hackers have often still managed to compromise organizations' security and gained access to immense amounts of data. One of the largest data breaches occurred in 2013 when hackers targeted  the point-of-sale system of American discount retailer Target, compromising the personal data of roughly 40 million shoppers. CNN Business reported that ""they either slipped malware into the terminals where customers swipe their credit cards, or they collected customer data while it was on route from Target to its credit card processors."" In just one single purchase at the register, masses of personal data is collected which when stolen has major ramifications. The financial market infrastructure and payment system will continue to be a work-in-progress as it continually battles with security hackers.


== Regulation and governance ==


=== United States ===
While not federally mandated in the United States PCI DSS is mandated by the Payment Card Industry Security Standard Council, which is composed of major credit card brands and maintains this as an industry standard. Some states have incorporated the standard into their laws.


==== Proposed toughening of federal law ====
The US Department of Justice announced in September 2014 that it will seek to impose a tougher law to combat overseas credit card trafficking. Authorities say the current statute is too weak because it allows people in other countries to avoid prosecution if they stay outside the United States when buying and selling the data and do not pass their illicit business through the U.S. The Department of Justice asks US Congress to amend the current law that would make it illegal for an international criminal to possess, buy or sell a stolen credit card issued by a U.S. bank independent of geographic location.


==== Cardholder liability ====
In the US, federal law limits the liability of cardholders to $50 in the event of theft of the actual credit card, regardless of the amount charged on the card, if reported within 60 days of receiving the statement. In practice, many issuers will waive this small payment and simply remove the fraudulent charges from the customer's account if the customer signs an affidavit confirming that the charges are indeed fraudulent. If the physical card is not lost or stolen, but rather just the credit card account number itself is stolen, then federal law guarantees cardholders have zero liability to the credit card issuer.


=== Canada ===
Regulation and Governance
In Canada, credit cards fall under the Bank Act and are overseen by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC). The Code of Conduct for the Credit and Debit Card Industry also applies to payment networks, ensuring transparency and fair treatment in the handling of merchant and consumer accounts. In Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) oversees federally regulated financial institutions.
Cardholder Liability
Canadian law limits cardholder liability for fraudulent transactions to a maximum of $50 if the fraud is reported promptly. Most credit cards, however, come with zero liability protection, meaning consumers aren't usually responsible for unauthorized transactions.
Fraud and Losses
In Canada, credit card fraud is a type of identity theft, and it is covered under Canada's Criminal Code. According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, more than half a billion dollars were lost in payment fraud losses in 2022, making fraud, especially involving credit cards, the top type of financial crime in our country. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) tracks and analyzes trends in fraud.


=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, credit cards are regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (amended 2006). This provides a number of protections and requirements. Any misuse of the card, unless deliberately criminal on the part of the cardholder, must be refunded by the merchant or card issuer.
The regulation of banks in the United Kingdom is undertaken by the: Bank of England (BoE); Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) a division of the BoE; and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) who manages the day to day oversight. There is no specific legislation or regulation that governs the credit card industry. However, the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) is the institution that all settlement members are a part of. The organisation works under the Banking Consolidation Directive to provide a means by which transactions can be monitored and regulated. UK Finance is the association for the UK banking and financial services sector, representing more than 250 firms providing credit, banking and payment-related services.


=== Australia ===

In Australia, credit card fraud is considered a form of identity crime. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has established standard definitions in relation to identity crime for use by law enforcement across Australia:

The term identity encompasses the identity of natural persons (living or deceased) and the identity of bodies corporate
Identity fabrication describes the creation of a fictitious identity
Identity manipulation describes the alteration of one's own identity
Identity theft describes the theft or assumption of a pre-existing identity (or significant part thereof), with or without consent and whether, in the case of an individual, the person is living or deceased
Identity crime is a generic term to describe activities/offences in which a perpetrator uses a fabricated identity, a manipulated identity, or a stolen/assumed identity to facilitate the commission of a crime(s).


==== Losses ====
Estimates created by the Attorney-General's Department show that identity crime costs Australia upwards of $1.6 billion each year, with the majority of about $900 million being lost by individuals through credit card fraud, identity theft and scams. In 2015, the Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism, Michael Keenan, released the report Identity Crime and Misuse in Australia 2013–14. This report estimated that the total direct and indirect cost of identity crime was closer to $2 billion, which includes the direct and indirect losses experienced by government agencies and individuals, and the cost of identity crimes recorded by police.


==== Cardholder liability ====
The victim of credit card fraud in Australia, still in possession of the card, is not responsible for anything bought on it without their permission. However, this is subject to the terms and conditions of the account. If the card has been reported physically stolen or lost the cardholder is usually not responsible for any transactions not made by them, unless it can be shown that the cardholder acted dishonestly or without reasonable care.


=== Hong Kong ===
Given increasing number of unauthorised payment card transactions involving frauds and scams, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued two Circulars on 25 April 2023.


== Vendors vs merchants ==
To prevent vendors from being ""charged back"" for fraud transactions, merchants can sign up for services offered by Visa and MasterCard called Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode, under the umbrella term 3-D Secure. This requires consumers to add additional information to confirm a transaction.
Often enough online merchants do not take adequate measures to protect their websites from fraud attacks, for example by being blind to sequencing.  In contrast to more automated product transactions, a clerk overseeing ""card present"" authorization requests must approve the customer's removal of the goods from the premises in real time.
If the merchant loses the payment, the fees for processing the payment, any currency conversion commissions, and the amount of the chargeback penalty. For obvious reasons, many merchants take steps to avoid chargebacks – such as not accepting suspicious transactions. This may spawn collateral damage, where the merchant additionally loses legitimate sales by incorrectly blocking legitimate transactions.  Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO) merchants are implementing agent-assisted automation which allows the call center agent to collect the credit card number and other personally identifiable information without ever seeing or hearing it.  This greatly reduces the probability of chargebacks and increases the likelihood that fraudulent chargebacks will be overturned.


== Famous credit fraud attacks ==
Between July 2005 and mid-January 2007, a breach of systems at TJX Companies exposed data from more than 45.6 million credit cards. Albert Gonzalez is accused of being the ringleader of the group responsible for the thefts. In August 2009 Gonzalez was also indicted for the biggest known credit card theft to date – information from more than 130 million credit and debit cards was stolen at Heartland Payment Systems, retailers 7-Eleven and Hannaford Brothers, and two unidentified companies.
In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe Systems. The information compromised included customer names, encrypted payment card numbers, expiration dates, and information relating to orders, Chief Security Officer Brad Arkin said.
In July 2013, press reports indicated four Russians and a Ukrainian were indicted in the U.S. state of New Jersey for what was called ""the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the United States."" Albert Gonzalez was also cited as a co-conspirator of the attack, which saw at least 160 million credit card losses and excess of $300 million in losses. The attack affected both American and European companies including Citigroup, Nasdaq OMX Group, PNC Financial Services Group, Visa licensee Visa Jordan, Carrefour, JCPenney and JetBlue Airways.
Between 27 November 2013 and 15 December 2013, a breach of systems at Target Corporation exposed data from about 40 million credit cards. The information stolen included names, account numbers, expiry dates, and card security codes.
From 16 July to 30 October 2013, a hacking attack compromised about a million sets of payment card data stored on computers at Neiman-Marcus. A malware system, designed to hook into cash registers and monitor the credit card authorisation process (RAM-scraping malware), infiltrated Target's systems and exposed information from as many as 110 million customers.
On 8 September 2014, The Home Depot confirmed that their payment systems were compromised. They later released a statement saying that the hackers obtained a total of 56 million credit card numbers as a result of the breach.
On 15 May 2016, in a coordinated attack, a group of around 100 individuals used the data of 1600 South African credit cards to steal US$12.7 million from 1400 convenience stores in Tokyo within three hours. By acting on a Sunday and in another country than the bank which issued the cards, they are believed to have won enough time to leave Japan before the heist was discovered.


== Countermeasures to combat card payment fraud ==
Countermeasures to combat credit card fraud include the following.


=== By merchants ===
PAN truncation – not displaying the full primary account number on receipts
Tokenization (data security) – using a reference (token) to the card number rather than the real card number
Requesting additional information, such as a PIN, ZIP code, or card security code
Performing geolocation validation, such as IP address
Use of reliance authentication, indirectly via PayPal, or directly via iSignthis or miiCard.


=== By card issuers ===
Fraud detection and prevention software that analyzes patterns of normal and unusual behavior as well as individual transactions in order to flag likely fraud. Profiles include such information as IP address. Technologies have existed since the early 1990s to detect potential fraud. One early market entrant was Falcon; other leading software solutions for card fraud include Actimize, SAS, BAE Systems Detica, and IBM.
Fraud detection and response business processes such as:
Contacting the cardholder to request verification
Placing preventative controls/holds on accounts that may have been victimized
Blocking card until transactions are verified by the cardholder
Investigating fraudulent activity
Strong Authentication measures such as:
Multi-factor Authentication, verifying that the account is being accessed by the cardholder through requirement of additional information such as account number, PIN, ZIP, challenge questions. There are five main factors to multi-factor authentication and they include:
Knowledge - things a user knows such as passwords or answers to secret questions.
Possession - an object the user should have in their possession such as the actual credit card.
Inherence - a biological trait of the user such as finger-print or facial recognition.
Location - where the user is at the time of the authentication - verify the user was the one to use the card.
Time - when the authentication is taking place - is it a strange hour or multiple times?
Multi possession-factor authentication, verifying that the account is being accessed by the cardholder through requirement of additional personal devices such as smart watch, smart phone challenge–response authentication
Out-of-band Authentication, verifying that the transaction is being done by the cardholder through a ""known"" or ""trusted"" communication channel such as text message, phone call, or security token device
Industry collaboration and information sharing about known fraudsters and emerging threat vectors
Automated Data Controls:
The use of automated data controls which are used to recognize when unusual activity or spending occur with a credit card. These controls can be used in real time to react ""...to anything suspicious they come upon, so the flow of fraudulent activity is stopped as soon as possible..."" (Johnston). The three main ways automated data controls protect information includes:
Reconciliation and verification to ensure that the controls are working properly.
Continuous monitoring and alerting which alerts the cardholder/bank when unusual activity is taking place.
Reporting which ensures organizations have proper controls in place to prevent fraudulent activity


=== By banks and financial institutions ===
Internal self-banking area  for the customer to carry out the transactions regardless of the weather conditions. The access door:
Identifies every cardholder that gains access to the designated area
Increases protection for customers during self-service procedures
Protects the ATMs and banking assets against unauthorized usage
The protected area can also be monitored by the bank's CCTV system
Cards use CHIP identification (ex PASSCHIP ) to decrease the possibility of card skimming


=== By governmental and regulatory bodies ===
Enacting consumer protection laws related to card fraud
Performing regular examinations and risk assessments of credit card issuers
Publishing standards, guidance, and guidelines for protecting cardholder information and monitoring for fraudulent activity
Regulation, such as that introduced in the SEPA and EU28 by the European Central Bank's 'SecuRe Pay' requirements and the Payment Services Directive 2 legislation.


=== By cardholders ===
Reporting lost or stolen cards
Reviewing charges regularly and reporting unauthorized transactions immediately
Keeping a credit card within the cardholder's view at all times, such as in restaurants and taxis
Installing virus protection software on personal computers
Using caution when using credit cards for online purchases, especially on non-trusted websites, make sure site is reputable
Keeping a record of account numbers, their expiration dates, and the phone number and address of each company in a secure place.
Not sending credit card information by unencrypted email
Not keeping written PIN numbers with the credit card.
Not giving out credit card numbers and other information online
Sign up for transaction alerts when card is used
Be aware of phishing schemes


== Disparities and Ethical Dilemmas in Credit Card Fraud ==
Generation Differences

Millennials are the biggest victims of all fraud, including credit and debit card fraud, digital wallet, digital payment, banking and tax fraud. Followed by them are the GenXers and then the GenZers.
Millennials spend the most time trying to recover money lost due to fraudulent charges, disputing fraudulent charges, and checking accounts for fraudulent or unusual activity out of any of the generational groups.
GenZers experienced fraud most often through digital payment apps such as PayPal, Venmo and Square. The other generations experienced most of their issues through credit card fraud.
Baby Boomers were found to have the lowest instances of fraudulent charges, and also spent the least amount of time trying to recover money due to fraudulent charges or to dispute these charges.

Racial Differences

""The Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (""CFPB"") produced reports on the connection between minority populations and consumer issues. Each report came to the same conclusion: unfair and deceptive practices have unique and disproportionate impacts on communities of color. These findings suggest that more needs to be done to protect these communities from fraud."" On top of this, hackers specifically target communities of color for reasons such as their need for additional income or credit, or their tendency to use certain types of financial products.
Additional report findings:
While Black and Latino consumers are more likely to experience fraud, Latino communities predominantly underreport compared with Black and White communities.
Latino and Black consumers report different rates of fraud concerning distinct categories of problem. The FTC found that their complaint database showed Black, and to a lesser extent Latino, communities experience higher rates of problems with credit bureaus and debt collections than White communities.
White and Latino communities experience higher rates of impersonator scams than Black communities. Also, according to FTC payment method data, Black and Latino communities use credit cards, with their accompanying legal protections, at a substantially lower rate than in White communities.

"Bank fraud is the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property owned or held by a financial institution, or to obtain money from depositors by fraudulently posing as a bank or other financial institution. In many instances, bank fraud is a criminal offence. 
While the specific elements of particular banking fraud laws vary depending on jurisdictions, the term bank fraud applies to actions that employ a scheme or artifice, as opposed to bank robbery or theft. For this reason, bank fraud is sometimes considered a white-collar crime.


== Types of bank fraud ==


=== Accounting fraud ===
In order to hide serious financial problems, some businesses have been known to use fraudulent bookkeeping to overstate sales and income, inflate the worth of the company's assets, or state a profit when the company is operating at a loss. These tampered records are then used to seek investment in the company's bond or security issues or to make fraudulent loan applications in a final attempt to obtain more money to delay the inevitable collapse of an unprofitable or mismanaged firm. Examples of accounting frauds include the Enron scandal, World Com and Ocala Funding. These companies ""cooked the books"" in order to appear as though they had profits each quarter, when in fact they were deeply in debt.


==== Demand draft fraud ====
Demand draft (DD) fraud typically involves one or more corrupt bank employees. Firstly, such employees remove a few DD leaves or DD books from stock and write them like a regular DD. Since they are insiders, they know the coding and punching of a demand draft. Such fraudulent demand drafts are usually drawn payable at a distant city without debiting an account. The draft is cashed at the payable branch. The fraud is discovered only when the bank's head office does the branch-wide reconciliation, which normally take six months, by which time the money is gone.


==== Remotely created check fraud ====

Remotely created checks are orders of payment created by the payee and authorized by the customer remotely, using a telephone or the internet by providing the required information including the MICR code from a valid check. They do not bear the signatures of the customers like ordinary cheques. Instead, they bear a legend statement ""Authorized by Drawer"". This type of instrument is usually used by credit card companies, utility companies, or telemarketers. The lack of signature makes them susceptible to fraud. The fraud is considered Demand Draft fraud in the US.


==== Uninsured deposits ====
A bank soliciting public deposits may be uninsured or not licensed to operate at all. The objective is usually to solicit for deposits to this uninsured ""bank,"" although some may also sell stock representing ownership of the ""bank."" Sometimes the names appear very official or very similar to those of legitimate banks. For instance, the unlicensed ""Chase Trust Bank"" of Washington D.C. appeared in 2002, bearing no affiliation to its seemingly apparent namesake; the real Chase Manhattan Bank is based in New York.
Accounting fraud has also been used to conceal other theft taking place within a company.


=== Bill discounting fraud ===
Essentially a confidence trick, a fraudster uses a company at their disposal to gain the bank's confidence, by posing as a genuine, profitable customer.  To give the illusion of being a desired customer, the company regularly and repeatedly uses the bank to get payment from one or more of its customers. These payments are always made, as the customers in question are part of the fraud, actively paying any and all bills the bank attempts to collect.  After the fraudster has gained the bank's trust, the company requests that the bank begin paying the company up front for bills it will collect from the customers later. Many banks will agree but are not likely to go whole hog right away. So again, business continues as normal for the fraudulent company, its fraudulent customers, and the unwitting bank. As the bank grows more comfortable with the arrangement, it will trust the company more and more and be willing to give it larger and larger sums of money up front. Eventually, when the outstanding balance between the bank and the company is sufficiently large, the company and its customers disappear, taking the money the bank paid up front and leaving no one to pay the bills issued by the bank.


==== Duplication or skimming of card information ====
This takes a number of forms, ranging from merchants copying clients' credit card numbers for use in later illegal activities or criminals using carbon copies from old mechanical card imprint machines to steal the info, to the use of tampered credit or debit card readers to copy the magnetic stripe from a payment card while a hidden camera captures the numbers on the face of the card.
Some fraudsters have attached fraudulent card stripe readers to publicly accessible ATMs to gain unauthorised access to the contents of the magnetic stripe as well as hidden cameras to illegally record users' authorisation codes. The data recorded by the cameras and fraudulent card stripe readers are subsequently used to produce duplicate cards that could then be used to make ATM withdrawals from the victims' accounts.


=== Cheque kiting ===
Cheque kiting exploits a banking system known as ""the float"" wherein money is temporarily counted twice. When a cheque is deposited to an account at Bank X, the money is made available immediately in that account even though the corresponding amount of money is not immediately removed from the account at Bank Y at which the cheque is drawn. Thus both banks temporarily count the cheque amount as an asset until the cheque formally clears at Bank Y. The float serves a legitimate purpose in banking, but intentionally exploiting the float when funds at Bank Y are insufficient to cover the amount withdrawn from Bank X is a form of fraud.


=== Forged or fraudulent documents ===
Forged documents are often used to conceal other thefts; banks tend to count their money meticulously so every penny must be accounted for. A document claiming that a sum of money has been borrowed as a loan, withdrawn by an individual depositor or transferred or invested can therefore be valuable to someone who wishes to conceal the fact that the bank's money has in fact been stolen and is now gone.


=== Forgery and altered cheques ===

Fraudsters have altered cheques to change the name (in order to deposit cheques intended for payment to someone else) or the amount on the face of cheques, simple altering can change $100.00 into $100,000.00. (However, transactions for such large values are routinely investigated as a matter of policy to prevent fraud.)
Instead of tampering with a real cheque, fraudsters may alternatively attempt to forge a depositor's signature on a blank cheque or even print their own cheques drawn on accounts owned by others, non-existent accounts, etc. They would subsequently cash the fraudulent cheque through another bank and withdraw the money before the banks realise that the cheque was a fraud.


=== Fraudulent loan applications ===
These take a number of forms varying from individuals using false information to hide a credit history filled with financial problems and unpaid loans to corporations using accounting fraud to overstate profits in order to make a risky loan appear to be a sound investment for the bank.


=== Fraudulent loans ===
One way to remove money from a bank is to take out a loan, which bankers are more than willing to encourage if they have good reason to believe that the money will be repaid in full with interest. A fraudulent loan, however, is one in which the borrower is a business entity controlled by a dishonest bank officer or an accomplice; the ""borrower"" then declares bankruptcy or vanishes and the money is gone. The borrower may even be a non-existent entity and the loan is merely an artifice to conceal a theft of a large sum of money from the bank. This can also be seen as a component within mortgage fraud (Bell, 2010).


=== Empty ATM envelope deposits ===
A criminal overdraft can result due to the account holder making a worthless or misrepresented deposit at an automated teller machine in order to obtain more cash than present in the account or to prevent a check from being returned due to non-sufficient funds. United States banking law makes the first $100 immediately available and it may be possible for much more uncollected funds to be lost by the bank the following business day before this type of fraud is discovered. The crime could also be perpetrated against another person's account in an ""account takeover"" or with a counterfeit ATM card, or an account opened in another person's name as part of an identity theft scam. The emergence of ATM deposit technology that scans currency and checks without using an envelope may prevent this type of fraud in the future.


=== Identity theft or Impersonation ===

Identity theft operates by obtaining information about an individual, then using the information to apply for identity cards, accounts and credit in that person's name. Often little more than name, parents' name, date and place of birth are sufficient to obtain a birth certificate; each document obtained then is used as identification in order to obtain more identity documents. Government-issued standard identification numbers such as ""social security numbers"" are also valuable to the fraudster.


=== Money laundering ===

The term ""money laundering"" dates back to the days of Al Capone; money laundering has since been used to describe any scheme by which the true origin of funds is hidden or concealed.
Money laundering is the process by which large amounts of illegally obtained money (from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other serious crimes) is given the appearance of having originated from a legitimate source.


=== Payment card fraud ===

Credit card fraud is widespread as a means of stealing from banks, merchants and clients.


=== Phishing or Internet fraud ===

Phishing, also known as Internet fraud, operates by sending forged e-mail, impersonating an online bank, auction or payment site; the e-mail directs the user to a forged web site which is designed to look like the login to the legitimate site but which claims that the user must update personal info. The information thus stolen is then used in other frauds, such as theft of identity or online auction fraud.
A number of malicious ""Trojan horse"" programmes have also been used to snoop on Internet users while online, capturing keystrokes or confidential data in order to send it to outside sites.
Fake websites can trick a visitor into downloading computer viruses that steal personal information. A visitor encounter security messages claiming his machine has viruses and instructing him to download new software, which is actually a virus.


=== Prime bank fraud ===
The ""prime bank"" operation which claims to offer an urgent, exclusive opportunity to cash in on the best-kept secret in the banking industry, guaranteed deposits in ""primebanks"", ""constitutional banks"", ""bank notes and bank-issued debentures from top 500 world banks"", ""bank guarantees and standby letters of credit"" which generate spectacular returns at no risk and are ""endorsed by the World Bank"" or various national governments and central bankers. However, these official-sounding phrases and more are the hallmark of the so-called ""prime bank"" fraud; they may sound great on paper, but the guaranteed offshore investment with the vague claims of an easy 100% monthly return are all fictitious financial instruments intended to defraud individuals.


=== Rogue traders ===
A rogue trader is a trader at a financial institution who engages in unauthorized trading; at times to recoup the loss they incurred in earlier trades. In those instances, out of fear and desperation, they manipulate the internal controls to circumvent detection to buy more time.
Unauthorized trading activities invariably produce more losses due to time constraints; most rogue traders are discovered at an early stage with losses ranging from $1 million to $100 million, but a very few working out of institutions with extremely lax controls were not discovered until the loss had reached well over a billion dollars. Rogue traders may not have criminal intent to defraud their employer to enrich themselves; they may be merely trying to recoup the loss to make their firm whole and salvage their employment.

Some of the largest unauthorized trading losses were discovered at Barings Bank (Nick Leeson), Daiwa Bank (Toshihide Iguchi), Sumitomo Corporation (Yasuo Hamanaka), Allfirst Bank (John Rusnak), Société Générale (Jérôme Kerviel), UBS (Kweku Adoboli), and JPMorgan Chase (Bruno Iksil).


=== Wire transfer fraud ===
Wire transfer networks such as the international SWIFT interbank fund transfer system are tempting as targets as a transfer, once made, is difficult or impossible to reverse. As these networks are used by banks to settle accounts with each other, rapid or overnight wire transfer of large amounts of money are commonplace; while banks have put checks and balances in place, there is the risk that insiders may attempt to use fraudulent or forged documents which claim to request a bank depositor's money be wired to another bank, often an offshore account in some distant foreign country.
There is a very high risk of fraud when dealing with unknown or uninsured institutions.
The risk is greatest when dealing with offshore or Internet banks (as this allows selection of countries with lax banking regulations), but not by any means limited to these institutions. There is an annual list of unlicensed banks on the US Treasury Department web site which currently is fifteen pages in length.
Also, a person may send a wire transfer from country to country. Since this takes a few days for the transfer to ""clear"" and be available to withdraw, the other person may still be able to withdraw the money from the other bank. A new teller or corrupt officer may approve the withdrawal since it is in pending status which then the other person cancels the wire transfer and the bank institution takes a monetary loss.


== Banking fraud by country ==


=== Australia ===
The Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework outlines the preventions, detection, investigation and reporting obligations set by the Australian Government for fraud control. The framework includes three documents called The Fraud Rule, Fraud Policy and Fraud Guidance 
The Fraud Rule is a legislative instrument binding all Commonwealth entities setting out the key requirements of fraud control.
The Fraud Policy is a government policy binding non-corporate Commonwealth entities setting out the procedural requirements for specific areas of fraud control such as investigations and reporting.
The Fraud Guidance preventing, detecting and dealing with fraud, supports best practice guidance for the Fraud Rule and Fraud Policy setting out the government's expectations for fraud control arrangements within all Commonwealth entities.
Other important acts and regulations in the Australian Government's fraud control framework include the:

CrimesAct 1914, which sets out criminal offences against the Commonwealth, such as fraud
Criminal Code 1995, which sets out criminal offences against the Commonwealth, such as fraudulent conduct
Public Service Act 1999 and the Public Service Regulations 1999, which provide for the establishment and management of the Australian Public Service and its employees
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime Regulations 2002, which provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.


=== United States ===
Under federal law, bank fraud in the United States is defined, and made illegal, primarily by the bank fraud statute in Title 18 of the U.S. Code. 18 U.S.C. § 1344 states:

Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice—
(1) to defraud a financial institution; or
(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises;
shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.
State law may also criminalize the same, or similar acts.
The bank fraud statute was enacted by Congress in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Williams v. United States, 458 U.S. 279 (1982), in which the Court held that check-kiting schemes did not constitute making false statements to financial institutions (18 U.S.C. § 1014). Section 1344 has subsequently been bolstered by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 500.
The bank fraud statute federally criminalizes check-kiting, check forging, non-disclosure on loan applications, diversion of funds, unauthorized use of automated teller machines (ATMs), credit card fraud, and other similar offenses. Section 1344 does not cover certain forms of money laundering, bribery, and passing bad checks. Other provisions cover these offenses.
The Supreme Court has embraced a broad interpretation of both of the numbered clauses within section 1344.  The Supreme Court has held that the first clause only requires the prosecution to show that the crime involved accounts controlled by a bank; the prosecution need not show actual financial loss to the bank or intent to cause such loss.  The Supreme Court has also held that the second clause does not require a showing of intent to defraud a financial institution.
In the United States, consumer liability for unauthorized electronic money transfers on debit cards is covered by Regulation E of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The extent of consumer liability, as detailed in section 205.6, is determined by the speed with which the consumer notifies the bank. If the bank is notified within 2 business days, the consumer is liable for $50. Over two business days the consumer is liable for $500, and over 60 business days, the consumer liability is unlimited. In contrast, all major credit card companies have a zero liability policy, effectively eliminating consumer liability in the case of fraud.

"A pish is an imitated bird call (usually a scold or alarm call) used by birders and ornithologists to attract birds (generally passerines). The action of making the sound is known as pishing or spishing. This technique is used by scientists to increase the effectiveness of bird diversity surveys, and by birders to attract species that they might not otherwise see.
Pishing is used most effectively in the Holarctic, where it is thought to work due to its similarity to the scold calls of tits and chickadees (birds in the family Paridae). These scold calls, a form of mobbing behaviour, attract other birds which come in to establish the nature of the potential threat. Acoustical analysis of pishing calls and the mobbing calls of tits shows that they share a frequency metric not used by other birds. Not surprisingly, pishing has little effect on birds in those parts of the world without tits or chickadees.
Another study noted that only passerine are attracted by pishing. Apart from the mobbing call hypothesis, it has also been suggested that pishing may be treated as an invitation to join a ""mixed-species foraging flock"" and birds do not themselves vocalize or show aggressive behaviour. The same study noted that pishing did not work in the old-world tropics and suggested that it may be due to the lower densities of migrants.
Pishing has also been found to work effectively in Southern Africa (imitating a call of the rattling cisticola). It also works effectively in Australia where, despite the absence of any members of the Paridae, a number of passerine species can be attracted.  Some birders in Australia use a variant of pishing called ""squeaking"" (making a kissing sound through pursed lips or against the back of one's hand) to which white-eared honeyeaters, several species of whistlers and grey fantails show an initial response and in turn attract other species.
Because pishing or squeaking disrupts the natural behaviour of a bird, birding organisations consider it unethical to make excessive use of this method of attracting birds. Such organisations recommend that, once the bird has been viewed, the birder cease pishing and allow the bird to return to its natural behaviour.

"Electoral fraud, sometimes referred to as election manipulation, voter fraud, or vote rigging, involves illegal interference with the process of an election, either by increasing the vote share of a favored candidate, depressing the vote share of rival candidates, or both. It differs from but often goes hand-in-hand with voter suppression. What exactly constitutes electoral fraud varies from country to country, though the goal is often election subversion.
Electoral legislation outlaws many kinds of election fraud, but other practices violate general laws, such as those banning assault, harassment or libel. Although technically the term ""electoral fraud"" covers only those acts which are illegal, the term is sometimes used to describe acts which are legal, but considered morally unacceptable, outside the spirit of an election or in violation of the principles of democracy. Show elections, featuring only one candidate, are sometimes classified as electoral fraud, although they may comply with the law and are presented more as referendums/plebiscites.
In national elections, successful electoral fraud on a sufficient scale can have the effect of a coup d'état, protest or corruption of democracy. In a narrow election, a small amount of fraud may suffice to change the result. Even if the outcome is not affected, the revelation of fraud can reduce voters' confidence in democracy.


== Law ==
Because U.S. states have primary responsibility for conducting elections, including federal elections, many forms of electoral fraud are prosecuted as state crimes. State election offenses include voter impersonation, double voting, ballot stuffing, tampering with voting machines, and fraudulent registration. Penalties vary widely by state and can include fines, imprisonment, loss of voting rights, and disqualification from holding public office.
The U.S. federal government prosecutes electoral crimes including voter intimidation, conspiracy to commit election fraud, bribery, interference with the right to vote, and fraud related to absentee ballots in federal elections.
In France, someone guilty may be fined and/or imprisoned for not more than one year, or two years if the person is a public official.


== Electorate manipulation ==

Electoral fraud can occur in advance of voting if the composition of the electorate is altered. The legality of this type of manipulation varies across jurisdictions. Deliberate manipulation of election outcomes is widely considered a violation of the principles of democracy.


=== Artificial migration or party membership ===
In many cases, it is possible for authorities to artificially control the composition of an electorate in order to produce a foregone result. One way of doing this is to move a large number of voters into the electorate prior to an election, for example by temporarily assigning them land or lodging them in flophouses. Many countries prevent this with rules stipulating that a voter must have lived in an electoral district for a minimum period (for example, six months) in order to be eligible to vote there. However, such laws can also be used for demographic manipulation as they tend to disenfranchise those with no fixed address, such as the homeless, travelers, Roma, students (studying full-time away from home), and some casual workers.
Another strategy is to permanently move people into an electoral district, usually through public housing. If people eligible for public housing are likely to vote for a particular party, then they can either be concentrated into one area, thus making their votes count for less, or moved into marginal seats, where they may tip the balance towards their preferred party. One example of this was the 1986–1990 Homes for votes scandal in the City of Westminster in England under Shirley Porter.
Immigration law may also be used to manipulate electoral demography. For instance, Malaysia gave citizenship to immigrants from the neighboring Philippines and Indonesia, together with suffrage, in order for a political party to ""dominate"" the state of Sabah; this controversial process was known as Project IC. In the United States, there have been allegations of an attempt to alter electoral demography via immigration as part of a far-right Great Replacement Theory conspiracy.""
A method of manipulating primary contests and other elections of party leaders are related to this. People who support one party may temporarily join another party (or vote in a crossover way, when permitted) in order to elect a weak candidate for that party's leadership. The goal ultimately is to defeat the weak candidate in the general election by the leader of the party that the voter truly supports. There were claims that this method was being utilised in the UK Labour Party leadership election in 2015, where Conservative-leaning Toby Young encouraged Conservatives to join Labour and vote for Jeremy Corbyn in order to ""consign Labour to electoral oblivion"". Shortly after, #ToriesForCorbyn trended on Twitter.


=== Disenfranchisement ===

The composition of an electorate may also be altered by disenfranchising some classes of people, rendering them unable to vote. In some cases, states had passed provisions that raised general barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy and comprehension tests, and record-keeping requirements, which in practice were applied against minority populations to discriminatory effect. From the turn of the century into the late 1960s, most African Americans in the southern states comprising the former Confederacy were disenfranchised by such measures. Corrupt election officials may misuse voting regulations such as a literacy test or requirement for proof of identity or address in such a way as to make it difficult or impossible for their targets to cast a vote. If such practices discriminate against a religious or ethnic group, they may so distort the political process that the political order becomes grossly unrepresentative, as in the post-Reconstruction or Jim Crow era until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Felons have been disenfranchised in many states as a strategy to prevent African Americans from voting.
Groups may also be disenfranchised by rules which make it impractical or impossible for them to cast a vote. For example, requiring people to vote within their electorate may disenfranchise serving military personnel, prison inmates, students, hospital patients or anyone else who cannot return to their homes. Polling can be set for inconvenient days, such as midweek or on holy days of religious groups: for example on the Sabbath or other holy days of a religious group whose teachings determine that voting is prohibited on such a day. Communities may also be effectively disenfranchised if polling places are situated in areas perceived by voters as unsafe, or are not provided within reasonable proximity (rural communities are especially vulnerable to this).
In some cases, voters may be invalidly disenfranchised, which is true electoral fraud. For example, a legitimate voter may be ""accidentally"" removed from the electoral roll, making it difficult or impossible for the person to vote.
In the Canadian federal election of 1917, during the Great War, the Canadian government, led by the Union Party, passed the Military Voters Act and the Wartime Elections Act. The Military Voters Act permitted any active military personnel to vote by party only and allowed that party to decide in which electoral district to place that vote. It also enfranchised those women who were directly related or married to an active soldier. These groups were believed to be disproportionately in favor of the Union government, as that party was campaigning in favor of conscription. The Wartime Elections Act, conversely, disenfranchised particular ethnic groups assumed to be disproportionately in favour of the opposition Liberal Party.


=== Division of opposition support ===
Stanford University professor Beatriz Magaloni described a model governing the behaviour of autocratic regimes. She proposed that ruling parties can maintain political control under a democratic system without actively manipulating votes or coercing the electorate. Under the right conditions, the democratic system is maneuvered into an equilibrium in which divided opposition parties act as unwitting accomplices to single-party rule. This permits the ruling regime to abstain from illegal electoral fraud.
Preferential voting systems such as score voting and single transferable vote, and in some cases, instant-runoff voting, can reduce the impact of systemic electoral manipulation and political duopoly.


=== Intimidation ===
Voter intimidation involves putting undue pressure on a voter or group of voters so that they will vote a particular way, or not at all. Absentee and other remote voting can be more open to some forms of intimidation as the voter does not have the protection and privacy of the polling location. Intimidation can take a range of forms including verbal, physical, or coercion. This was so common that in 1887, a Kansas Supreme Court in New Perspectives on Election Fraud in The Gilded Age said ""[...] physical retaliation constituted only a slight disturbance and would not vitiate an election.""


==== Violence or threats of violence ====
In its simplest form, voters from a particular demographic or known to support a particular party or candidate are directly threatened by supporters of another party or candidate or by those hired by them. In other cases, supporters of a particular party make it known that if a particular village or neighborhood is found to have voted the 'wrong' way, reprisals will be made against that community. Another method is to make a general threat of violence, for example, a bomb threat which has the effect of closing a particular polling place, thus making it difficult for people in that area to vote. One notable example of outright violence was the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack, where followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh deliberately contaminated salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon, in an attempt to weaken political opposition during county elections. Historically, this tactic included Lynching in the United States to terrorize potential African American voters in some areas.
Polling places in an area known to support a particular party or candidate may be targeted for vandalism, destruction or threats, thus making it difficult or impossible for people in that area to vote.


==== Legal threats ====
In this case, voters will be made to believe, accurately or otherwise, that they are not legally entitled to vote, or that they are legally obliged to vote a particular way. Voters who are not confident about their entitlement to vote may also be intimidated by real or implied authority figures who suggest that those who vote when they are not entitled to will be imprisoned, deported or otherwise punished. 
For example, in 2004, in Wisconsin and elsewhere voters allegedly received flyers that said, ""If you already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the Presidential Election"", implying that those who had voted in earlier primary elections were ineligible to vote. Also, ""If anybody in your family has ever been found guilty of anything you can't vote in the Presidential Election."" Finally, ""If you violate any of these laws, you can get 10 years in prison and your children will be taken away from you.""


==== Coercion ====
Employers can coerce the voters' decision, through strategies such as explicit or implicit threats of job loss.


=== Disinformation ===
People may distribute false or misleading information in order to affect the outcome of an election. For example, in the Chilean presidential election of 1970, the U.S. government's Central Intelligence Agency used ""black propaganda""—materials purporting to be from various political parties—to sow discord between members of a coalition between socialists and communists.
Another method, allegedly used in Cook County, Illinois, in 2004, is to falsely tell particular people that they are not eligible to vote In 1981 in New Jersey, the Republican National Committee created the Ballot Security Task Force to discourage voting among Latino and African-American citizens of New Jersey. The task force identified voters from an old registration list and challenged their credentials. It also paid off-duty police officers to patrol polling sites in Newark and Trenton, and posted signs saying that falsifying a ballot is a crime.
Another use of disinformation is to give voters incorrect information about the time or place of polling, thus causing them to miss their chance to vote. As part of the 2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal, Elections Canada traced fraudulent phone calls, telling voters that their polling stations had been moved, to a telecommunications company that worked with the Conservative Party.
Similarly in the United States, right-wing political operatives Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were indicted on several counts of bribery and election fraud in October 2020 regarding a voter disinformation scheme they undertook in the months prior to the 2020 United States presidential election. The pair hired a firm to make nearly 85,000 robocalls that targeted minority neighborhoods in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Michigan, and Illinois. Like Democratic constituencies in general that year, minorities voted overwhelmingly by absentee ballot, many judging it a safer option during the COVID-19 pandemic than in-person voting. Baselessly, the call warned potential voters if they submitted their votes by mail that authorities could use their personal information against them, including threats of police arrest for outstanding warrants and forced debt collection by creditors.
On October 24, 2022, Wohl and Burkman pleaded guilty in Cuyahoga County, Ohio Common Pleas Court to one count each of felony telecommunications fraud. Commenting on the tactic of using disinformation to suppress voter turnout, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael C. O’Malley said the two men had ""infringed upon the right to vote"", and that ""by pleading guilty, they were held accountable for their un-American actions.”


==== False claims of fraud ====

False claims of electoral fraud can be used as a basis for attempting to overturn an election. During and after the 2020 presidential election, incumbent President Donald Trump made numerous baseless allegations of electoral fraud by supporters of Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The Trump campaign lost numerous legal challenges to the results. President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro also made numerous claims of electoral fraud without evidence during and after the 2022 Brazilian presidential election.


=== Dead people voting ===
Dead people voting refers to instances where ballots are fraudulently cast in the name of deceased individuals. While concerns about this type of electoral fraud often arise, studies suggest that such cases are extremely rare. In many democratic systems, safeguards exist to prevent this, such as regularly updating voter rolls and requiring identification at polling stations. However, in some cases, fraudulent actors may exploit outdated records or use the identification of deceased individuals to attempt illegal voting.
In Indonesia, dead people voting occurred during the 2020 local elections and the 2024 general election. There have been similar incidents reported in smaller regional elections.


== Vote buying ==
Vote buying occurs when a political party or candidate seeks to buy the vote of a voter in an upcoming election. Vote buying can take various forms such as a monetary exchange, as well as an exchange for necessary goods or services.


== Voting process and results ==
A list of threats to voting systems, or electoral fraud methods considered as sabotage are kept by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.


=== Misleading or confusing ballot papers ===
Ballot papers may be used to discourage votes for a particular party or candidate, using the design or other features which confuse voters into voting for a different candidate. For example, in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Florida's butterfly ballot paper was criticized as poorly designed, leading some voters to vote for the wrong candidate. While the ballot itself was designed by a Democrat, it was the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, who was most harmed by voter errors because of this design. Poor or misleading design is usually not illegal and therefore not technically election fraud, but it can nevertheless subvert the principles of democracy.
Sweden has a system with separate ballots used for each party, to reduce confusion among candidates. However, ballots from small parties such as Piratpartiet, Junilistan and Feministiskt initiativ have been omitted or placed on a separate table in the election to the EU parliament in 2009. Ballots from Sweden Democrats have been mixed with ballots from the larger Swedish Social Democratic Party, which used a very similar font for the party name written on the top of the ballot.
Another method of confusing people into voting for a different candidate from the one intended is to run candidates or create political parties with similar names or symbols to an existing candidate or party. The goal is to mislead voters into voting for the false candidate or party. Such tactics may be particularly effective when many voters have limited literacy in the language used on the ballot. Again, such tactics are usually not illegal but they often work against the principles of democracy.
Another possible source of electoral confusion is multiple variations of voting by different electoral systems. This may cause ballots to be counted as invalid if the wrong system is used. For instance, if a voter puts a first-past-the-post cross in a numbered single transferable vote ballot paper, it is invalidated. For example, in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom, up to three different voting systems and types of ballots may be used, based on the jurisdictional level of the election. Local elections are determined by single transferable votes; Scottish parliamentary elections by the additional member system; and UK Parliamentary elections by first-past-the-post.


=== Ballot stuffing ===

Ballot stuffing, or ""ballot-box stuffing"", is the illegal practice of one person submitting multiple ballots during a vote in which only one ballot per person is permitted.

In the 1883 election for the district of Cook, in Queensland, Australia, arrests were made in connection with accusations of ballot stuffing, and the election committee subsequently changed the result of the election
A 2006 version of the Sequoia touchscreen voting machine had a yellow service ""back"" button on the back that could allow repeated voting under specific circumstances
During the 2014 Afghan presidential election, Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) recorded Ziaul Haq Amarkhel, the secretary of Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission, telling local officials to ""take sheep to the mountains, stuff them, and bring them back"", in an apparent reference to ballot stuffing
During the 2018 Russian presidential election, there were multiple instances, some caught on camera, throughout Russia of voters and polling staff alike stuffing multiple votes in the ballot box
Major League Baseball's All-Star Game has had problems with ballot stuffing on occasion, such as in 1957, 1999 and 2015
Ballot stuffing was reported during the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election.


=== Misrecording of votes ===
Votes may be misrecorded at source, on a ballot paper or voting machine, or later in misrecording totals. The 2019 Malawian general election was nullified by the Constitutional Court in 2020 because many results were changed by use of correction fluid, as well as duplicate, unverified and unsigned results forms. California allows correction fluid and tape, so changes can be made after the ballot leaves the voter.
Where votes are recorded through electronic or mechanical means, the voting machinery may be altered so that a vote intended for one candidate is recorded for another, or electronic results are duplicated or lost, and there is rarely evidence whether the cause was fraud or error.
Many elections feature multiple opportunities for unscrupulous officials or 'helpers' to record an elector's vote differently from their intentions. Voters who require assistance to cast their votes are particularly vulnerable to having their votes stolen in this way. For example, a blind or illiterate person may be told that they have voted for one party when in fact they have been led to vote for another.


=== Misuse of proxy votes ===
Proxy voting is particularly vulnerable to election fraud, due to the amount of trust placed in the person who casts the vote. In several countries, there have been allegations of retirement home residents being asked to fill out 'absentee voter' forms. When the forms are signed and gathered, they are secretly rewritten as applications for proxy votes, naming party activists or their friends and relatives as the proxies. These people, unknown to the voter, cast the vote for the party of their choice. In the United Kingdom, this is known as 'granny farming.'


=== Destruction of ballots ===
One of methods of electoral fraud is to destroy ballots for an opposing candidate or party.
While mass destruction of ballots can be difficult to achieve without drawing attention to it, in a very close election it may be possible to destroy a small number of ballot papers without detection, thereby changing the overall result. Blatant destruction of ballot papers can render an election invalid and force it to be re-run. If a party can improve its vote on the re-run election, it can benefit from such destruction as long as it is not linked to it.
During the Bourbon Restoration in late 19th century Spain, the organized “loss” of voting slips (pucherazo) was used to maintain the agreed alternation between the Liberals and the Conservatives. This system of local political domination, especially rooted in rural areas and small cities, was known as caciquismo.


=== Invalidation of ballots ===
Another method is to make it appear that the voter has spoiled his or her ballot, thus rendering it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to the paper, making it appear that the voter has voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance. It would be difficult to do this to a large number of paper ballots without detection in some locales, but altogether too simple in others, especially jurisdictions where legitimate ballot spoiling by voter would serve a clear and reasonable aim: for example emulating protest votes in jurisdictions that have recently had and since abolished a ""none of the above"" or ""against all"" voting option; civil disobedience where voting is mandatory; and attempts at discrediting or invalidating an election. An unusually large share of invalidated ballots may be attributed to loyal supporters of candidates that lost in primaries or previous rounds, did not run or did not qualify to do so, or some manner of protest movement or organized boycott.
In 2016, during the EU membership referendum, Leave-supporting voters in the UK alleged without evidence that the pencils supplied by voting stations would allow votes to be erased their votes from the ballot.


=== Tampering with electronic voting systems ===


==== General tampering ====

All voting systems face threats of some form of electoral fraud. The types of threats that affect voting machines vary. Research at Argonne National Laboratories revealed that a single individual with physical access to a machine, such as a Diebold Accuvote TS, can install inexpensive, readily available electronic components to manipulate its functions.
Other approaches include:

Tampering with the software of a voting machine to add malicious code that alters vote totals or favors a candidate in any way.
Multiple groups have demonstrated this possibility
Private companies manufacture these machines. Many companies will not allow public access or review of the machines' source code, claiming fear of exposing trade secrets
Tampering with the hardware of the voting machine to alter vote totals or favor any candidate.
Some of these machines require a smart card to activate the machine and vote. However, a fraudulent smart card could attempt to gain access to voting multiple times or be pre-loaded with negative votes to favor one candidate over another, as has been demonstrated
Abusing the administrative access to the machine by election officials might also allow individuals to vote multiple times
Election results that are sent directly over the internet from the polling place centre to the vote-counting authority can be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where they are diverted to an intermediate website where the man in the middle flips the votes in favour of a certain candidate and then immediately forwards them on to the vote-counting authority. All votes sent over the internet violate the chain of custody and hence should be avoided by driving or flying memory cards in locked metal containers to the vote-counters. For purposes of getting quick preliminary total results on election night, encrypted votes can be sent over the internet, but final official results should be tabulated the next day only after the actual memory cards arrive in secure metal containers and are counted


==== South Africa ====
In 1994, the election which brought majority rule and put Nelson Mandela in office, South Africa's election compilation system was hacked, so they re-tabulated by hand.


==== Ukraine ====
In 2014, Ukraine's central election system was hacked. Officials found and removed a virus and said the totals were correct.


=== Voter impersonation ===


==== United Kingdom ====
Academic research has generally found voter impersonation to be 'exceptionally rare' in the UK. The Conservative government passed the Elections Act 2022, which mandated photo identification.


==== United States ====

Voter impersonation is considered extremely rare in the US by experts. Since 2013, several states have passed voter ID laws to counter voter impersonation. Voter ID requirements are generally popular among Americans  and proponents have argued that it can be difficult to detect voter impersonation without them. Voter ID laws' effectiveness given the rarity of voter impersonation, and their potential to disenfranchise citizens without the right ID have created controversy. By August 2016, four federal court rulings (Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota) overturned laws or parts of such laws because they placed undue burdens on minorities.
Allegations of widespread voter impersonation often turn out to be false. The North Carolina Board of Elections reported in 2017 that out of 4,769,640 votes cast in the November 2016 election in North Carolina, only one illegal vote would potentially have been blocked by the voter ID law. The investigation found fewer than 500 incidences of invalid ballots cast, the vast majority of which were cast by individuals on probation for felony who were likely not aware that this status disqualified them from voting, and the total number of invalid votes was far too small to have affected the outcome of any race in North Carolina in the 2016 election.


=== Artificial results ===

In particularly corrupt regimes, the voting process may be nothing more than a sham, to the point that officials simply announce whatever results they want, sometimes without even bothering to count the votes. While such practices tend to draw international condemnation, voters typically have little if any recourse, as there would seldom be any ways to remove the fraudulent winner from power, short of a revolution.
In Turkmenistan, incumbent President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov received 97.69% of votes in the 2017 election, with his sole opponent, who was seen as pro-government, in fact being appointed by Berdymukhamedov. In Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili received 96.2% of votes in the election following the Rose Revolution while his ally Nino Burjanadze was an interim head of state.


=== Postal ballot fraud ===

In both the United Kingdom and the United States, experts estimate that voting fraud by mail has affected only a few local elections, without likely any impact at the national level. In April 2020, a 20-year voter fraud study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the level of mail-in ballot fraud ""exceedingly rare"" in the United States, occurring only in ""0.00006 percent"" of instances nationally, and, with Oregon's mail-in-ballots, ""0.000004 percent—about five times less likely than getting hit by lightning"".
Types of fraud have included pressure on voters from family or others, since the ballot is not always cast in secret;
collection of ballots by dishonest collectors who mark votes or fail to deliver ballots; and insiders changing, challenging or destroying ballots after they arrive.
A measure championed as a way to prevent some types of mail-in fraud has been to require the voter's signature on the outer envelope, which is compared to one or more signatures on file before taking the ballot out of the envelope and counting it. Not all places have standards for signature review,
and there have been calls to update signatures more often to improve this review. While any level of strictness involves rejecting some valid votes and accepting some invalid votes, there have been concerns that signatures are improperly rejected from young and minority voters at higher rates than others, with no or limited ability of voters to appeal the rejection.
Some problems have inherently limited scope, such as family pressure, while others can affect several percent of the vote, such as dishonest collectors and overly strict signature verification.


=== Non-citizen voting ===


==== Canada ====

In 2019, Elections Canada identified 103,000 non-citizens who were illegally on Canada's federal voters register. It subsequently identified roughly 3,500 cases of potential non-citizens who voted in 2019, but noted that it was not a coordinated effort and did not affect the result in any riding. ""But almost a year after Canadians headed to the polls, the agency says it's still trying to determine how many of those cases — if any — involved non-Canadian citizens casting ballots.""


==== United States ====

Illegal non-citizen voting is considered extremely rare in the United States by most experts due to the severe penalties associated with the practice including deportation, incarceration or fines in addition to jeopardizing their attempt to naturalize. The federal form to register a voter does not require proof of citizenship, though non-citizens have been found to vote only in very small numbers.


== In legislature ==
Vote fraud can also take place in legislatures. Some of the forms used in national elections can also be used in parliaments, particularly intimidation and vote-buying. Because of the much smaller number of voters, however, election fraud in legislatures is qualitatively different in many ways. Fewer people are needed to 'swing' the election, and therefore specific people can be targeted in ways impractical on a larger scale. For example, Adolf Hitler achieved his dictatorial powers due to the Enabling Act of 1933. He attempted to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to pass the Act by arresting members of the opposition, though this turned out to be unnecessary to attain the needed majority. Later, the Reichstag was packed with Nazi party members who voted for the Act's renewal.
In many legislatures, voting is public, in contrast to the secret ballot used in most modern public elections. This may make their elections more vulnerable to some forms of fraud since a politician can be pressured by others who will know how the legislator voted. However, it may also protect against bribery and blackmail, since the public and media will be aware if a politician votes in an unexpected way. Since voters and parties are entitled to pressure politicians to vote a particular way, the line between legitimate and fraudulent pressure is not always clear.
As in public elections, proxy votes are particularly prone to fraud. In some systems, parties may vote on behalf of any member who is not present in parliament. This protects those members from missing out on voting if prevented from attending parliament, but it also allows their party to prevent them from voting against its wishes. In some legislatures, proxy voting is not allowed, but politicians may rig voting buttons or otherwise illegally cast ""ghost votes"" while absent.


== Detection and prevention ==
The three main strategies for the prevention of electoral fraud in society are:

Auditing the election process
Deterrence through consistent and effective prosecution
Cultivation of mores that discourage corruption
Some of the main fraud prevention tactics can be summarised as secrecy and openness. The secret ballot prevents many kinds of intimidation and vote selling, while transparency at all other levels of the electoral process prevents and allows detection of most interference.
Electoral fraud is generally considered difficult to prove, as perpetrators are highly motivated to conceal their acts. Researchers must often rely on inferential methods to uncover unusual patterns that could indicate election fraud, as fraud often cannot be observed directly.


=== Election audits ===

Election auditing refers to any review conducted after polls close for the purpose of determining whether the votes were counted accurately (a results audit) or whether proper procedures were followed (a process audit), or both.
Audits vary and can include checking that the number of voters signed in at the polls matches the number of ballots, seals on ballot boxes and storage rooms are intact, computer counts (if used) match hand counts, and counts are accurately totaled.
Election recounts are a specific type of audit, with elements of both results and process audits.


=== Prosecution ===
In the United States the goal of prosecutions is not to stop fraud or keep fraudulent winners out of office; it is to deter and punish years later. The Justice Department has published Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses in eight editions from 1976 to 2017, under Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush and Trump. It says, ""Department does not have authority to directly intercede in the election process itself. ... overt criminal investigative measures should not ordinarily be taken ... until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded."" Sentencing guidelines provide a range of 0–21 months in prison for a first offender; offense levels range from 8 to 14. Investigation, prosecution and appeals can take over 10 years.
In the Philippines, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was arrested in 2011 following the filing of criminal charges against her for electoral sabotage, in connection with the 2007 Philippine general election. She was accused of conspiring with election officials to ensure the victory of her party's senatorial slate in the province of Maguindanao, through the tampering of election returns.


=== Secret ballot ===

The secret ballot, in which only the voter knows how they have voted, is believed by many to be a crucial part of ensuring free and fair elections through preventing voter intimidation or retribution. Others argue that the secret ballot enables election fraud (because it makes it harder to verify that votes have been counted correctly) and that it discourages voter participation. Although the secret ballot was sometimes practiced in ancient Greece and was a part of the Constitution of the Year III of 1795, it only became common in the nineteenth century. Secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in the former British colony—now an Australian state—of Tasmania on 7 February 1856. By the turn of the century, the practice had spread to most Western democracies.
In the United States, the popularity of the Australian ballot grew as reformers in the late 19th century sought to reduce the problems of election fraud. Groups such as the Greenbackers, Nationalist, and more fought for those who yearned to vote, but were exiled for their safety. George Walthew, Greenback, helped initiate one of the first secret ballots in America in Michigan in 1885. Even George Walthew had a predecessor in John Seitz, Greenback, who campaigned a bill to ""preserve the purity of elections"" in 1879 after the discovery of Ohio's electoral fraud in congressional elections.
The efforts of many helped accomplish this and led to the spread of other secret ballots all across the country. As mentioned on February 18, 1890, in the Galveston News ""The Australian ballot has come to stay. It protects the independence of the voter and largely puts a stop to vote to buy."" Before this, it was common for candidates to intimidate or bribe voters, as they would always know who had voted which way.


=== Transparency ===
Most methods of preventing electoral fraud involve making the election process completely transparent to all voters, from nomination of candidates through casting of the votes and tabulation. A key feature in ensuring the integrity of any part of the electoral process is a strict chain of custody.
To prevent fraud in central tabulation, there has to be a public list of the results from every single polling place. This is the only way for voters to prove that the results they witnessed in their election office are correctly incorporated into the totals.
End-to-end auditable voting systems provide voters with a receipt to allow them to verify their vote was cast correctly, and an audit mechanism to verify that the results were tabulated correctly and all votes were cast by valid voters. However, the ballot receipt does not permit voters to prove to others how they voted, since this would open the door towards forced voting and blackmail. End-to-end systems include Punchscan and Scantegrity, the latter being an add-on to optical scan systems instead of a replacement.
In many cases, election observers are used to help prevent fraud and assure voters that the election is fair. International observers (bilateral and multilateral) may be invited to observe the elections (examples include election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), European Union election observation missions, observation missions of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as international observation organised by NGOs, such as CIS-EMO, European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations (ENEMO), etc.). Some countries also invite foreign observers (i.e. bi-lateral observation, as opposed to multi-lateral observation by international observers).
In addition, national legislatures of countries often permit domestic observation. Domestic election observers can be either partisan (i.e. representing interests of one or a group of election contestants) or non-partisan (usually done by civil society groups). Legislations of different countries permit various forms and extents of international and domestic election observation.
Election observation is also prescribed by various international legal instruments. For example, paragraph 8 of the 1990 Copenhagen Document states that ""The [OSCE] participating States consider that the presence of observers, both foreign and domestic, can enhance the electoral process for States in which elections are taking place. They, therefore, invite observers from any other CSCE participating States and any appropriate private institutions and organisations who may wish to do so to observe the course of their national election proceedings, to the extent permitted by law. They will also endeavour to facilitate similar access for election proceedings held below the national level. Such observers will undertake not to interfere in the electoral proceedings"".
Critics note that observers cannot spot certain types of election fraud like targeted voter suppression or manipulated software of voting machines.


=== Statistical indicators and election forensics ===
Various forms of statistics can be indicators of election fraud—e.g., exit polls which diverge from the final results. Well-conducted exit polls serve as a deterrent to electoral fraud. However, exit polls are still notoriously imprecise. For instance, in the Czech Republic, some voters are afraid or ashamed to admit that they voted for the Communist Party (exit polls in 2002 gave the Communist party 2–3 percentage points less than the actual result). Variations in willingness to participate in an exit poll may result in an unrepresentative sample compared to the overall voting population.
When elections are marred by ballot-box stuffing (e.g., the Armenian presidential elections of 1996 and 1998), the affected polling stations will show abnormally high voter turnouts with results favouring a single candidate. By graphing the number of votes against turnout percentage (i.e., aggregating polling stations results within a given turnout range), the divergence from bell-curve distribution gives an indication of the extent of the fraud. Stuffing votes in favour of a single candidate affects votes vs. turnout distributions for that candidate and other candidates differently; this difference could be used to quantitatively assess the number of votes stuffed. Also, these distributions sometimes exhibit spikes at round-number turnout percentage values. High numbers of invalid ballots, overvoting or undervoting are other potential indicators. Risk-limiting audits are methods to assess the validity of an election result statistically without the effort of a full election recount.
Though election forensics can determine if election results are anomalous, the statistical results still need to be interpreted. Alan Hicken and Walter R. Mebane describe the results of election forensic analyses as not providing ""definitive proof"" of fraud. Election forensics can be combined with other fraud detection and prevention strategies, such as in-person monitoring.


=== Voting machine integrity ===

One method for verifying voting machine accuracy is 'parallel testing', the process of using an independent set of results compared to the original machine results. Parallel testing can be done prior to or during an election. During an election, one form of parallel testing is the voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) or verified paper record (VPR). A VVPAT is intended as an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the stored electronic results. This method is only effective if statistically significant numbers of voters verify that their intended vote matches both the electronic and paper votes.
On election day, a statistically significant number of voting machines can be randomly selected from polling locations and used for testing. This can be used to detect potential fraud or malfunction unless manipulated software would only start to cheat after a certain event like a voter pressing a special key combination (Or a machine might cheat only if someone does not perform the combination, which requires more insider access but fewer voters).
Another form of testing is 'Logic & Accuracy Testing (L&A)', pre-election testing of voting machines using test votes to determine if they are functioning correctly.


=== Open source ===
Another method to ensure the integrity of electronic voting machines is independent software verification and certification. Once a software is certified, code signing can ensure the software certified is identical to that which is used on election day. Some argue certification would be more effective if voting machine software was publicly available or open source. VotingWorks has created an open-source voting system in the United States.
Certification and testing processes conducted publicly and with oversight from interested parties can promote transparency in the election process. The integrity of those conducting testing can be questioned.
Testing and certification can prevent voting machines from being a black box where voters cannot be sure that counting inside is done as intended.
One method that people have argued would help prevent these machines from being tampered with would be for the companies that produce the machines to share the source code, which displays and captures the ballots, with computer scientists. This would allow external sources to make sure that the machines are working correctly.

"Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol used to share files, printers, serial ports, and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. On Microsoft Windows, the SMB implementation consists of two vaguely named Windows services: ""Server"" (ID: LanmanServer) and ""Workstation"" (ID: LanmanWorkstation). It uses NTLM or Kerberos protocols for user authentication. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.
SMB was originally developed in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM to share access to files and printers across a network of systems running IBM's IBM PC DOS. In 1987, Microsoft and 3Com implemented SMB in LAN Manager for OS/2, at which time SMB used the NetBIOS service atop the NetBIOS Frames protocol as its underlying transport. Later, Microsoft implemented SMB in Windows NT 3.1 and has been updating it ever since, adapting it to work with newer underlying transports: TCP/IP and NetBT. SMB over QUIC was introduced in Windows Server 2022. 
In 1996, Microsoft published a version of SMB 1.0 with minor modifications under the Common Internet File System (CIFS ) moniker. CIFS was compatible with even the earliest incarnation of SMB, including LAN Manager's. It supports symbolic links, hard links, and larger file size, but none of the features of SMB 2.0 and later. Microsoft's proposal, however, remained an Internet Draft and never achieved standard status. Microsoft has since discontinued the CIFS moniker but continues developing SMB and publishing subsequent specifications. Samba is a free software reimplementation of the SMB protocol and the Microsoft extensions to it.


== Features ==
Server Message Block (SMB) enables file sharing, printer sharing, network browsing, and inter-process communication (through named pipes) over a computer network. SMB serves as the basis for Microsoft's Distributed File System implementation.
SMB relies on the TCP and IP protocols for transport. This combination allows file sharing over complex, interconnected networks, including the public Internet. The SMB server component uses TCP port 445. SMB originally operated on NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 - NetBIOS Frames or NBF - and over IPX/SPX, and later on NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT), but Microsoft has since deprecated these protocols. On NetBT, the server component uses three TCP or UDP ports: 137 (NETBIOS Name Service), 138 (NETBIOS Datagram Service), and 139 (NETBIOS Session Service).
In Microsoft Windows, two vaguely named Windows services implement SMB. The ""Server"" service (ID: LanmanServer) is in charge of serving shared resources. The ""Workstation"" service (ID: LanmanWorkstation) maintains the computer name and helps access shared resources on other computers. SMB uses the Kerberos protocol to authenticate users against Active Directory on Windows domain networks. On simpler, peer-to-peer networks, SMB uses the NTLM protocol.
Windows NT 4.0 SP3 and later can digitally sign SMB messages to prevent some man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing may be configured individually for incoming SMB connections (by the ""LanmanServer"" service) and outgoing SMB connections (by the ""LanmanWorkstation"" service). The default setting for Windows domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and later is to not allow unsigned incoming connections. As such, earlier versions of Windows that do not support SMB signing from the get-go (including Windows 9x) cannot connect to a Windows Server 2003 domain controller.
SMB supports opportunistic locking (see below) on files in order to improve performance. Opportunistic locking support has changed with each Windows Server release.


=== Opportunistic locking ===
In the SMB protocol, opportunistic locking is a mechanism designed to improve performance by controlling caching of network files by the client. Unlike traditional locks, opportunistic lock (OpLocks) are not strictly file locking or used to provide mutual exclusion.
There are four types of opportunistic locks.

Batch Locks
Batch OpLocks were created originally to support a particular behavior of DOS batch file execution operation in which the file is opened and closed many times in a short period, which is a performance problem. To solve this, a client may ask for an OpLock of type ""batch"". In this case, the client delays sending the close request and if a subsequent open request is given, the two requests cancel each other.
Level-1 OpLocks / Exclusive Locks
When an application opens in ""shared mode"" a file hosted on an SMB server which is not opened by any other process (or other clients) the client receives an exclusive OpLock from the server. This means that the client may now assume that it is the only process with access to this particular file, and the client may now cache all changes to the file before committing it to the server. This is a performance improvement, since fewer round-trips are required in order to read and write to the file. If another client/process tries to open the same file, the server sends a message to the client (called a break or revocation) which invalidates the exclusive lock previously given to the client. The client then flushes all changes to the file.
Level-2 OpLocks
If an exclusive OpLock is held by a client and a locked file is opened by a third party, the client has to relinquish its exclusive OpLock to allow the other client's write/read access. A client may then receive a ""Level 2 OpLock"" from the server. A Level 2 OpLock allows the caching of read requests but excludes write caching.
Filter OpLocks
Added in Windows NT 4.0, Filter Oplocks are similar to Level 2 OpLocks but prevent sharing-mode violations between file open and lock reception. Microsoft advises use of Filter OpLocks only where it is important to allow multiple readers and Level 2 OpLocks in other circumstances. Clients holding an OpLock do not really hold a lock on the file, instead they are notified via a break when another client wants to access the file in a way inconsistent with their lock. The other client's request is held up while the break is being processed.
Breaks
In contrast with the SMB protocol's ""standard"" behavior, a break request may be sent from server to client. It informs the client that an OpLock is no longer valid. This happens, for example, when another client wishes to open a file in a way that invalidates the OpLock. The first client is then sent an OpLock break and required to send all its local changes (in case of batch or exclusive OpLocks), if any, and acknowledge the OpLock break. Upon this acknowledgment the server can reply to the second client in a consistent manner.


=== Performance ===
The use of the SMB protocol has often correlated with a significant increase in broadcast traffic on a network. However the SMB itself does not use broadcasts—the broadcast problems commonly associated with SMB actually originate with the NetBIOS service location protocol. By default, a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 server used NetBIOS to advertise and locate services. NetBIOS functions by broadcasting services available on a particular host at regular intervals. While this usually makes for an acceptable default in a network with a smaller number of hosts, increased broadcast traffic can cause problems as the number of hosts on the network increases. The implementation of name resolution infrastructure in the form of Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) or Domain Name System (DNS) resolves this problem. WINS was a proprietary implementation used with Windows NT 4.0 networks, but brought about its own issues and complexities in the design and maintenance of a Microsoft network.
Since the release of Windows 2000, the use of WINS for name resolution has been deprecated by Microsoft, with hierarchical Dynamic DNS now configured as the default name resolution protocol for all Windows operating systems. Resolution of (short) NetBIOS names by DNS requires that a DNS client expand short names, usually by appending a connection-specific DNS suffix to its DNS lookup queries. WINS can still be configured on clients as a secondary name resolution protocol for interoperability with legacy Windows environments and applications. Further, Microsoft DNS servers can forward name resolution requests to legacy WINS servers in order to support name resolution integration with legacy (pre-Windows 2000) environments that do not support DNS.
Network designers have found that latency has a significant impact on the performance of the SMB 1.0 protocol, that it performs more poorly than other protocols like FTP. Monitoring reveals a high degree of ""chattiness"" and a disregard of network latency between hosts. For example, a VPN connection over the Internet will often introduce network latency. Microsoft has explained that performance issues come about primarily because SMB 1.0 is a block-level rather than a streaming protocol, that was originally designed for small LANs; it has a block size that is limited to 64K, SMB signing creates an additional overhead and the TCP window size is not optimized for WAN links. Solutions to this problem include the updated SMB 2.0 protocol, Offline Files, TCP window scaling and WAN optimization devices from various network vendors that cache and optimize SMB 1.0 and 2.0.


== History ==


=== SMB 1.0 ===
Barry Feigenbaum originally designed SMB at IBM in early 1983 with the aim of turning DOS INT 21h local file access into a networked file system. Microsoft made considerable modifications to the most commonly used version and included SMB support in the LAN Manager operating system it had started developing for OS/2 with 3Com around 1990. Microsoft continued to add features to the protocol in Windows for Workgroups (c. 1992) and in later versions of Windows. LAN Manager authentication was implemented based on the original legacy SMB specification's requirement to use IBM ""LAN Manager"" passwords, but implemented DES in a flawed manner that allowed passwords to be cracked. Later, Kerberos authentication was also added. The Windows domain logon protocols initially used 40-bit encryption outside of the United States, because of export restrictions on stronger 128-bit encryption (subsequently lifted in 1996 when President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13026).
SMB 1.0 (or SMB1) was originally designed to run on NetBIOS Frames (NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2). Since then, it has been adapted to NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX), and NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT). Also, since Windows 2000, SMB runs on TCP using TCP port 445, a feature known as ""direct host SMB"". There is still a thin layer (similar to the Session Message packet of NetBT's Session Service) between SMB and TCP. Windows Server 2003, and legacy NAS devices use SMB1 natively.
SMB1 is an extremely chatty protocol, which is not such an issue on a local area network (LAN) with low latency.  It becomes very slow on wide area networks (WAN) as the back and forth handshake of the protocol magnifies the inherent high latency of such a network. Later versions of the protocol reduced the high number of handshake exchanges. One approach to mitigating the inefficiencies in the protocol is to use WAN optimization products such as those provided by Riverbed, Silver Peak, or Cisco. A better approach is to upgrade to a later version of SMB. This includes upgrading both NAS devices as well as Windows Server 2003. The most effective method to identify SMB1 traffic is with a network analyzer tool, such as Wireshark.  Microsoft also provides an auditing tool in Windows Server 2016 to track down devices that use SMB1.
Microsoft has marked SMB1 as deprecated in June 2013. Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 version 1709 do not have SMB1 installed by default.


=== CIFS ===
In 1996, when Sun Microsystems announced WebNFS, Microsoft launched an initiative to rename SMB to Common Internet File System (CIFS) and added more features, including support for symbolic links, hard links, larger file sizes, and an initial attempt at supporting direct connections over TCP port 445 without requiring NetBIOS as a transport (a largely experimental effort that required further refinement). Microsoft submitted some partial specifications as Internet Drafts to the IETF. These submissions have since expired.


=== SMB 2.0 ===
Microsoft introduced a new version of the protocol (SMB 2.0 or SMB2) in 2006 with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Although the protocol is proprietary, its specification has been published to allow other systems to interoperate with Microsoft operating systems that use the new protocol.
SMB2 reduces the 'chattiness' of the SMB 1.0 protocol by reducing the number of commands and subcommands from over a hundred to just nineteen. It has mechanisms for pipelining, that is, sending additional requests before the response to a previous request arrives, thereby improving performance over high-latency links. It adds the ability to compound multiple actions into a single request, which significantly reduces the number of round-trips the client needs to make to the server, improving performance as a result. SMB1 also has a compounding mechanism—known as AndX—to compound multiple actions, but Microsoft clients rarely use AndX. It also introduces the notion of ""durable file handles"": these allow a connection to an SMB server to survive brief network outages, as are typical in a wireless network, without having to incur the overhead of re-negotiating a new session.
SMB2 includes support for symbolic links. Other improvements include caching of file properties, improved message signing with HMAC SHA-256 hashing algorithm and better scalability by increasing the number of users, shares and open files per server among others. The SMB1 protocol uses 16-bit data sizes, which amongst other things, limits the maximum block size to 64K. SMB2 uses 32- or 64-bit wide storage fields, and 128 bits in the case of file-handles, thereby removing previous constraints on block sizes, which improves performance with large file transfers over fast networks.
Windows Vista/Server 2008 and later operating systems use SMB2 when communicating with other machines also capable of using SMB2. SMB1 continues in use for connections with older versions of Windows, as well various vendors' NAS solutions. Samba 3.5 also includes experimental support for SMB2. Samba 3.6 fully supports SMB2, except the modification of user quotas using the Windows quota management tools.
When SMB2 was introduced it brought a number of benefits over SMB1 for third party implementers of SMB protocols. SMB1, originally designed by IBM, was reverse engineered, and later became part of a wide variety of non-Windows operating systems such as Xenix, OS/2 and VMS (Pathworks). X/Open standardized it partially; Microsoft had submitted Internet-Drafts describing SMB2 to the IETF, partly in response to formal IETF standardization of version 4 of the Network File System in December 2000 as IETF RFC 3010; however, those SMB-related Internet-Drafts expired without achieving any IETF standards-track approval or any other IETF endorsement. (See http://ubiqx.org/cifs/Intro.html for historical detail.) SMB2 is also a relatively clean break with the past. Microsoft's SMB1 code has to work with a large variety of SMB clients and servers. SMB1 features many versions of information for commands (selecting what structure to return for a particular request) because features such as Unicode support were retro-fitted at a later date. SMB2 involves significantly reduced compatibility-testing for implementers of the protocol. SMB2 code has considerably less complexity since far less variability exists (for example, non-Unicode code paths become redundant as SMB2 requires Unicode support).
Apple migrated to SMB2 (from their own Apple Filing Protocol, now legacy) starting with OS X 10.9 ""Mavericks"". This transition was fraught with compatibility problems though. Non-default support for SMB2 appeared in fact in OS X 10.7, when Apple abandoned Samba in favor of its own SMB implementation called SMBX after Samba adopted GPLv3.
The Linux kernel's CIFS client file system has SMB2 support since version 3.7.


=== SMB 2.1 ===
SMB 2.1, introduced with Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2, introduced minor performance enhancements with a new opportunistic locking mechanism.


=== SMB 3.0 ===
SMB 3.0 (previously named SMB 2.2) was introduced with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. It brought several significant changes that are intended to add functionality and improve SMB2 performance, notably in virtualized data centers:

the SMB Direct Protocol (SMB over remote direct memory access [RDMA])
SMB Multichannel (multiple connections per SMB session),
SMB Transparent Failover
It also introduces several security enhancements, such as end-to-end encryption and a new AES based signing algorithm.


=== SMB 3.0.2 ===
SMB 3.0.2 (known as 3.02 at the time) was introduced with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2; in those and later releases, the earlier SMB version 1 can be optionally disabled to increase security.


=== SMB 3.1.1 ===
SMB 3.1.1 was introduced with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. This version supports AES-128 GCM encryption in addition to AES-128 CCM encryption added in SMB3, and implements pre-authentication integrity check using SHA-512 hash. SMB 3.1.1 also makes secure negotiation mandatory when connecting to clients using SMB versions that support it.


== Specifications ==
The specifications for the SMB are proprietary and were initially closed, thereby forcing other vendors and projects to reverse-engineer the protocol to interoperate with it. The SMB 1.0 protocol was eventually published some time after it was reverse engineered, whereas the SMB 2.0 protocol was made available from Microsoft's Open Specifications Developer Center from the outset.


== Third-party implementations ==


=== Samba ===

In 1991, Andrew Tridgell started the development of Samba, a free-software re-implementation (using reverse engineering) of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol for Unix-like systems,  initially to implement an SMB server to allow PC clients running the DEC Pathworks client to access files on SunOS machines. Because of the importance of the SMB protocol in interacting with the widespread Microsoft Windows platform, Samba became a popular free software implementation of a compatible SMB client and server to allow non-Windows operating systems, such as Unix-like operating systems, to interoperate with Windows.
As of version 3 (2003), Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows NT 4.0 server domain, either as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or as a domain member. Samba4 installations can act as an Active Directory domain controller or member server, at Windows 2008 domain and forest functional levels.
Package managers in Linux distributions can search for the cifs-utils package.  The package is from the Samba maintainers.


=== Netsmb ===
NSMB (Netsmb and SMBFS) is a family of in-kernel SMB client implementations in BSD operating systems. It was first contributed to FreeBSD 4.4 by Boris Popov, and is now found in a wide range of other BSD systems including NetBSD and macOS. The implementations have diverged significantly ever since.
The macOS version of NSMB is notable for its now-common scheme of representing symlinks. This ""Minshall-French"" format shows symlinks as textual files with a .symlink extension and a Xsym\n magic number, always 1067 bytes long. This format is also used for storing symlinks on native SMB servers or unsupported filesystems. Samba supports this format with an mfsymlink option. Docker on Windows also seems to use it.


=== NQ ===
NQ is a family of portable SMB client and server implementations developed by Visuality Systems, an Israel-based company established in 1998 by Sam Widerman, formerly the CEO of Siemens Data Communications. The NQ family comprises an embedded SMB stack (written in C), a Pure Java SMB Client, and a storage SMB Server implementation. All solutions support the latest SMB 3.1.1 dialect. NQ for Linux, NQ for WinCE, iOS, Android, VxWorks and other real-time operating systems are all supported by the configurable NQ solution.


=== MoSMB ===
MoSMB is a user space SMB implementation for Linux. It supports  SMB 2.x and SMB 3.x. Key features include Cloud-scale Active-Active Scale-out Clusters, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Multichannel, Transparent Failover and Continuous Availability. MoSMB also supports Amazon S3 object storage as storage backend in addition to POSIX file systems such as ext4, ZFS, Lustre, Ceph, etc.


=== Fusion File Share by Tuxera ===
Fusion File Share by Tuxera is a proprietary SMB server implementation developed by Tuxera that can be run either in kernel or user space. It supports SMB 3.1.1 and all previous versions, additionally advanced SMB features like continuous availability (persistent handles) scale-out, RDMA (SMB Direct), SMB multichannel, transparent compression, shadow copy.


=== Likewise ===
Likewise developed a CIFS/SMB implementation (versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and SMB 3.0) in 2009 that provided a multiprotocol, identity-aware platform for network access to files used in OEM storage products built on Linux/Unix based devices. The platform could be used for traditional NAS, Cloud Gateway, and Cloud Caching devices for providing secure access to files across a network.  Likewise was purchased by EMC Isilon in 2012.


=== KSMBD ===
KSMBD is an open source in-kernel CIFS/SMB server implementation for the Linux kernel. Compared to user-space implementations, it provides better performance and makes it easier to implement some features such as SMB Direct. It supports SMB 3.1.1 and previous versions.


== Security ==
Over the years, there have been many security vulnerabilities in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol or components on which it directly relies. Other vendors' security vulnerabilities lie primarily in a lack of support for newer authentication protocols like NTLMv2 and Kerberos in favor of protocols like NTLMv1, LanMan, or plaintext passwords. Real-time attack tracking shows that SMB is one of the primary attack vectors for intrusion attempts, for example the 2014 Sony Pictures attack, and the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017. In 2020, two SMB high-severity vulnerabilities were disclosed and dubbed as SMBGhost (CVE-2020-0796) and SMBleed (CVE-2020-1206), which when chained together can provide RCE (Remote Code Execution) privilege to the attacker.

"National Anti-Fraud Center (NAFC) is a Chinese fraud prevention and reporting mobile application developed by the Ministry of Public Security. It was first published in March 2021. The software claims that it can maintain telecommunications network security, create channels for reporting online fraud and raising awareness for fraud prevention. The Chinese government claims that the app can be used to detect possible telecommunication frauds in addition to reporting them, and heavily promotes its installation. The app was temporarily removed from the App Store in 2024 and 2025.


== Functionalities ==
The National Anti-Fraud Center app detects received calls, SMS and downloaded apps, and if suspicious content is found and identified as fraudulent, it will actively warn users. The app also provides a ""I want to report"" function, which enables users to submit suspicious cell phone numbers, SMS, websites, APPs and other information to the public security department for processing. In addition, the app also pushes articles on fraud prevention to users to promote fraud prevention.
For iOS devices, the app is only available for Apple accounts with China-based locations and cannot be downloaded from accounts in other countries.


== Controversies ==
The app has faced many controversies. Citizens are reportedly forced to install it on their phone despite its excessive permission requests, privacy violations, and identifying and interrogating users who visit overseas financial websites.
Registration for this application requires facial recognition, in addition to scanning the phone for installed applications. It has been reported that citizens in cities like Shenzhen are forced to install it on their smartphone, leading to complaints. Citizens who have visited foreign financial news websites like Bloomberg are reportedly tracked by the app and interrogated by the police.

"Cookie stuffing is a deceptive tactic in affiliate marketing. In affiliate marketing, individuals (affiliates) are compensated for enticing consumers to buy products through specially crafted URLs that set cookies on users' browsers to track which affiliate referred the user to the site. Affiliates engaging in cookie stuffing use invasive techniques, like pop-up ads, to falsely claim credit for sales that they did not facilitate.
Many affiliate marketing programs prohibit cookie stuffing, considering it fraudulent. It causes retail companies to lose revenue, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers and lost sales for legitimate affiliates. In 2014, Shawn Hogan, a prominent figure in eBay's affiliate program was convicted of wire fraud for engaging in cookie stuffing and received a five-month-long federal prison sentence along with a $25,000 fine. However, despite occasional high-profile cases, researchers in 2015 found that cookie stuffing remains rare and most users do not encounter it frequently.


== Background ==
Affiliate marketing is a strategy employed by online retailers like GoDaddy, Amazon, and eBay to amplify website traffic. In the framework, third-party entities, or affiliates, receive compensation for promoting the retailer's products, aiming to increase sales of promoted products. The entry barrier for affiliates is very low, making affiliate marketing an accessible revenue model for those establishing a website without significant assets or brand recognition. The compensation model for affiliate marketing is predominantly performance-based, operating on a cost-per-sale structure where affiliates are paid only upon the successful purchase of the advertised product. This compensation model serves as a safeguard against potential fraud as it only requires a payment after a confirmed sale. The advantage of affiliate marketing lies in this perceived reduction of fraud risk compared to alternative advertising models. The efficacy of this risk reduction, however, hinges on the affiliate's ability to robustly track sales. In reality, tracking by affiliates often falls short, paving the way for deceptive practices such as cookie stuffing.


== Mechanism ==

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

Retailers use third-party cookies to track purchases driven by affiliates. Affiliates place advertisements on their website that contain specially crafted URLs. When users click on the link, a cookie is stored on the user's browser. Later, if the user continues with a purchase from the retailer, the merchant reads this cookie to identify which affiliate will receive a commission for the sale.
Cookie stuffing works by tricking the browser into setting this cookie without the user clicking an affiliate link. Cookie stuffing can be done by embedding web pages in other web pages or via ads that open in separate windows without the user's knowledge. Later, if the user happens to purchase a product on that retailer's website, the retailer will pay a commission for the sale due to the presence of the cookie, even though the affiliate did not drive a sale.


== Techniques ==
Fraudulent affiliate marketers use multiple techniques to perform cookie stuffing. In a 2015 study covering 11,700 domains that had engaged in cookie stuffing, Chachra et al. found that over 91% of websites used redirects. This was manifested in the form of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) redirects (i.e., the use of the 302 and 301 status codes to redirect users to a different domain) or the use of Flash or JavaScript to redirect users. Other techniques used by fraudulent affiliates include using iframes to embed the online marketer's website in the code or using scripts and image tags to request specific resources that would set the cookie for the affiliate on the destination website.
In the same study, Chachra et al. found that over 84% of cookies set by fraudulent marketers employed referrer obfuscation to hide their activities from retail websites. The referrer header is a HTTP header set by the browser that is often used by affiliates to determine the legitimacy of requests from affiliate marketing websites. Fraudulent marketers would set up websites referencing an image or a JavaScript file from an innocuous-looking domain. This domain would then redirect to multiple other domains before arriving at the destination affiliate website. By redirecting the user through several innocuous-looking domains, the fraudulent marketer can trick the browser into setting the wrong website in the referrer header of the request being made to the affiliate website, making it harder for the affiliate marketing firm to track down the source of the request.
Another technique used by some malicious entities includes hijacking or publishing malicious browser extensions on the Chrome and Firefox extension stores. By modifying requests sent to online retailers and setting cookies or redirecting users to affiliate websites on startup, the malicious extension can trick online marketers into thinking that the user legitimately clicked on an affiliate link to navigate to their marketplace.


== Legality ==

Most affiliate marketing programs prohibit cookie stuffing because it tends to undermine genuine product advertising efforts. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission lays out advertising guidelines mandating the clear disclosure of financial relationships between advertisers and retailers. Cookie stuffing deliberately operates in an opaque manner for users, conflicting with the guidelines that emphasize transparency to the user.
In certain cases in the United States, cookie stuffing has been considered a form of wire fraud. In 2006, when eBay collaborated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a sting operation targeting top affiliate marketers, Shawn Hogan, eBay's largest affiliate marketer, was found to have engaged in cookie stuffing. His strategy involved modifying his website to load resources from eBay's servers, thereby setting affiliate cookies on users' browsers. The technique falsely attributed subsequent eBay purchases to Hogan's site. Despite Hogan making over $28 million through eBay's affiliate commissions, it was determined that Hogan's activities did not contribute any substantial revenue to eBay. In subsequent legal proceedings, Hogan pleaded guilty to a single wire fraud charge, leading to a five-month federal prison sentence and a $25,000 fine.
Around the same time, another incident involved eBay's second-most-prolific affiliate marketer, Brian Dunning, who employed similar tactics to defraud eBay of over $5 million during 2006–2007. Dunning's fraudulent activities came to light as he utilized methods akin to Shawn Hogan's cookie-stuffing scheme. During the legal proceedings, Dunning admitted to collaborating with Hogan in executing the fraud, offering to teach him key techniques. Hogan denied the claim, alleging that Dunning ripped off his techniques. Dunning further alleged that he paid an account manager at an affiliate management network CJ Affiliates, for insider knowledge of how the affiliate network operated, although this claim was not officially confirmed. Dunning, like Hogan, pleaded guilty to a single wire fraud charge and was sentenced to 15 months in prison, followed by three years of supervision.


== Impact ==
Despite several high-profile cases, only a small number of users encounter cookie stuffing on the web. This has led researchers to infer that the practice of cookie stuffing is confined to a very small group of affiliates. Additionally, cookie stuffing and other forms of affiliate marketing fraud disproportionately impact larger affiliate marketing networks that oversee numerous affiliate marketing programs, as opposed to smaller in-house programs. This is because smaller in-house affiliate programs are motivated by their parent companies to eradicate fraud, given its direct impact on their revenue. On the other hand, larger affiliate marketing networks, which earn a commission only when a transaction occurs between an affiliate and an online marketer, are incentivized not to actively police their programs and to avoid detecting fraudulent practices. In certain cases, this behavioral practice has led to online marketers severing ties with affiliate marketing networks.
Cookie stuffing has adverse effects on both end users and legitimate affiliates. For end users, a loss of revenue for the parent online retail company in the form of fraudulent affiliate commission payouts could result in items that would otherwise have been sold at a discount being listed at higher prices to offset the losses incurred by online marketers. Similarly, a decrease in the amount of traffic for an online marketing firm could lead to lower demand and, subsequently, higher prices for items. Legitimate affiliates, who employ advertising to attract consumers, suffer from the impact of cookie stuffing, as they lose out on conversions from affiliate sales that were manipulated as a result of cookie stuffing which overrides legitimate affiliate cookies.

"A pig butchering scam (Chinese: 杀猪盘, sha zhu pan or shazhupan, translated as the killing pig game) is a type of online scam where the victim is encouraged to make increasing financial contributions over a long period, usually in the form of cryptocurrency. Such scams are commonplace on social media and dating apps, and often involve elements of catfishing, investment fraud and romance scams. The scammer builds trust with the victim through online communication, subsequently persuading them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. The ""butchering"" or ""slaughtering"" of the victim transpires when their assets or funds are stolen. Perpetrators are typically victims of a fraud factory, where they are lured to travel internationally under false pretenses, trafficked to another location, and forced to commit the fraud by organised crime gangs.
Contact begins with unsolicited telephone calls with extended or repeated contact, fake profiles on dating apps, or romantic interest from strangers, all with requests for personal information with the view to financially profile the target. After gaining the victim's trust, the scammer offers too-good-to-be-true rates of return on trades or investments using genuine-looking but fraudulent websites or apps. The scammer may pressure the victim to invest quickly, offer extravagant gifts which require the release of money, claim difficulties in withdrawing funds from supposed investment returns, and give inconsistent or vague details about the investment. A scammer will often try to isolate their victim by monopolizing their attention away from loved ones, who may otherwise realise the victim is falling prey to a scam. 
Scams can be detected using simple precautions. To avoid being scammed, experts recommend that persons conduct due diligence and verify the identity of the fake persona, such as by asking for their long-used legitimate LinkedIn and Facebook accounts with their verifiable family and colleagues in their social network. Scammers get angry and abusive when pressed for verifiable details for them or their investments scams. To avoid being detected, scammers also often avoid giving out their WhatsApp number, and prefer apps where their phone number is hidden such as Telegram or WeChat. Many scammers obtain their own WhatsApp-linked fraudulent phone number through a burner phone, virtual number, phone number mule, or caller ID spoofing, and then avoid videocall verification. Experts also recommend that potential victims insist on multiple, long videocalls to verify the identity of the potential scammer, confirm the identity of mentioned companies with registration and regulatory bodies, not invest in any scheme through people met online but not in person, cut off contact with potential scammers and their platforms, and immediately alert local, state, or federal authorities and loved ones. Legitimate opportunities rarely require rushed decisions.
In 2024, crypto fraud was estimated to have had a value of US$12.4 billion, of which high-yield investment program (HYIP) scams and pig butchering scams contributed 50.2% and 33.2% respectively, with pig butchering scams growing at the rapid rate of 40% over the previous year. In October 2023, 12% of Americans using dating apps experienced exposure to this type of fraud, up from 5% in 2018. The scam originated in China in 2016 or earlier, and proliferated in Southeast Asia amid the COVID-19 pandemic.


== History ==

Pig-butchering scams originated in 2016 or earlier as a regional scam in China, originally finding their victims on same-sex dating sites before expanding to opposite-sex dating sites as well. The term ""pig butchering"" arises from an analogy comparing the initial phase of gaining the victims' trust to the fattening of pigs before slaughtering them.
The modus operandi later spread throughout Southeast Asia at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sihanoukville, Cambodia—once a prosperous gambling town—many local gambling gangs transformed casinos into scam operation centers performing pig-butchering scams. This was likely a result of a lack of casino attendance on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Cambodian government cracking down on commercial gambling. Many operations are also run from areas of Myanmar which are outside central government control because of 
the ongoing civil war, with one important hub being the town of Myawaddy in Kayin State, near the border with Thailand. According to the UN Human Rights Office, hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked and are trapped in scam centres in Cambodia and Myanmar, with other operations being run from Laos, the Philippines and Thailand. Many of the groups that run pig-butchering scams are overseas Chinese criminal syndicates based in Southeast Asia, who traffic ethnic Chinese and others into fraud factories and force these people to commit the fraud.
Pig-butchering scams gained international momentum through the exploitation of online dating apps and social media platforms. Scammers crafted elaborate fake identities to establish romantic or emotional connections with victims, thus marking a departure from conventional financial scams by integrating psychological manipulation. This early phase of these scams primarily targeted local populations but quickly expanded as digital connectivity grew.
The scams evolved significantly with the integration of sophisticated techniques, including the creation of fake online investment platforms and the use of social engineering. A key aspect of this evolution was the use of cryptocurrency for transactions, which appealed to scammers due to its difficulty to trace and recover. The scams' globalization can be attributed to the increased ubiquity of digital interactions and the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies, which provided a new avenue for such fraudulent activities on a global scale.


=== Notable cases of pig butchering ===
The 2023 failure of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, United States, was directly tied to a pig-butchering scam; CEO Shan Hanes was discovered to have embezzled $47 million from the bank in an attempt to secure his presumed funds. Hanes was charged in federal court with embezzlement in February 2024 and pleaded guilty in May 2024.  He was later sentenced to 24 years in prison.


== Implementation ==
Pig-butchering scams involve a series of meticulously planned steps to deceive and exploit victims, typically focusing on cryptocurrency investment fraud.

Gaining trust: Scams often begin with casual conversations initiated by the scammer, who may pretend to have received the victim's contact details accidentally or through a mutual acquaintance. These initial interactions are designed to build trust and may involve the use of attractive profile images to lure victims.
Introducing the investment: As trust is established, the scammer introduces the victim to a fraudulent investment scheme, promising significant returns in a short period. The scammers use persuasive tactics and counterfeit investment portfolios to convince victims of the scheme's legitimacy.
Collecting money: After persuading the victim to invest, scammers collect funds, often through digital payment platforms or cryptocurrencies, to complicate tracking and tracing of the transactions.
Disappearance of the scammer: Once a substantial amount has been collected, or when victims attempt to withdraw funds, scammers become unreachable, delete their online presence, or create new identities, leaving the victims with no way to recover their funds.
Furthermore, the scammers develop fake brokerage websites and mobile applications to add legitimacy to their scheme, making it difficult for victims to distinguish them from genuine platforms.


== Countermeasures ==
The IRS has issued warnings about the rising prevalence of these scams, particularly targeting U.S. taxpayers. The agency notes that losses often reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, with some victims losing as much as $2 million.
An important aspect of countering pig-butchering scams involves tracing stolen cryptocurrencies. This process is intricate due to the decentralized and pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, and requires specialised tools and knowledge. In 2022, for example, the FBI set up the Virtual Assets Unit, with the express remit of addressing crypto-based financial crime.
The process typically begins with the collection of relevant transaction data, such as transaction IDs and wallet addresses associated with the scam. Advanced blockchain analysis tools are then employed to trace the path of the stolen funds. These tools can identify patterns and link different transactions to specific wallets, which are essential in building a case against the perpetrators.


== Consequences ==
The scam typically combines elements of romance and investment fraud, and often involve the gradual building of a relationship with the victim, leading to significant financial losses. Victims are lured into investing in fake opportunities, particularly with cryptocurrencies, and end up losing large sums of money. The psychological impact is equally severe, as victims not only face financial ruin but also the loss of what they perceived as a genuine, intimate relationship. These types of scams are particularly insidious because they play on both the financial aspirations and emotional needs of individuals, leaving victims feeling betrayed, embarrassed, and reluctant to discuss their experience with others or report it to authorities.


== In popular culture ==
The 2023 Chinese movie No More Bets is a crime drama based on interviews with real victims of the scams. It garnered attention and success in China, bringing the scams and the issues related to them to the forefront of public discourse. The movie highlights the plight of the numerous low-level scammers who are themselves victims of coercion, having been lured from their homes by promises of stable employment, only to find themselves trapped and forced into committing these scams.

FBI Public Service Announcement: Cryptocurrency Investment Schemes"
"Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices and/or networks. It has been variously defined as ""a crime committed on a computer network, especially the Internet"";  Cybercriminals may exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, disrupt services, and cause financial or reputational harm to individuals, organizations, and governments.
In 2000, the tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders classified cyber crimes into five categories: unauthorized access, damage to computer data or programs, sabotage to hinder the functioning of a computer system or network, unauthorized interception of data within a system or network, and computer espionage.
Internationally, both state and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nation-state are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare. Warren Buffett has stated that cybercrime is the ""number one problem with mankind"", and that it ""poses real risks to humanity"".
The World Economic Forum's (WEF) 2020 Global Risks Report highlighted that organized cybercrime groups are joining forces to commit criminal activities online, while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the US. There are also many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, legally or otherwise.
The World Economic Forum's 2023 Global Risks Report ranked cybercrime as one of the top 10 risks facing the world today and for the next 10 years. If viewed as a nation state, cybercrime would count as the third largest economy in the world. In numbers, cybercrime is predicted to cause over 9 trillion US dollars in damages worldwide in 2024.  


== Classification ==
Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities, including computer fraud, financial crimes, scams, cybersex trafficking, and ad-fraud.
A proposed taxonomy classifies cybercrime into two top-level groups: pure-technology cybercrime and cyber-advanced crime. Pure-technology cybercrime ""targets or victimizes the computer technology ecosystem"" to ""disrupt the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a computer-technology ecosystem"", while cyber-advanced crime ""uses computer technology to target or victimize natural persons, governments, business entities, or property"" in order to ""deprive, disrupt or damage entities or assets.""


=== Computer fraud ===

Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data, or to gain unlawful access to a computer or system. Computer fraud that involves the use of the Internet is also called internet fraud. The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction, but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization.
Forms of computer fraud include hacking into computers to alter information, distributing malicious code such as computer worms or viruses, installing malware or spyware to steal data, phishing, and advance-fee scams.
Other forms of fraud may be committed using computer systems, including bank fraud, carding, identity theft, extortion, and theft of classified information. These types of crimes often result in the loss of personal or financial information.


=== Digital arrest ===
 
Digital arrest is a form of online fraud where perpetrators impersonate law enforcement officials to deceive victims. This scam typically involves contacting individuals via phone, falsely claiming they are implicated in criminal activity related to a parcel containing illegal goods, drugs, counterfeit documents, or other contraband. In some variations, scammers target the victim's relatives or friends, falsely stating the victim is in custody due to criminal involvement or an accident. Victims are then coerced into remaining on camera and isolating themselves, while the fraudsters extract personal and financial information under the guise of an official investigation, ultimately transferring the victim's assets to money mule accounts. 
To detect and prevent the fraud, be wary of unsolicited calls from supposed law enforcement demanding immediate payment or personal information. Legitimate law enforcement agencies rarely conduct investigations in this manner. Verify the identity of the caller independently by contacting the relevant agency directly through official channels. Remember, the government agencies never put anyone under digital arrest, it's not permissible.


=== Fraud factories ===

A fraud factory is a collection of large fraud organizations, usually involving cyber fraud and human trafficking operations.


=== Cyberterrorism ===

The term cyberterrorism refers to acts of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources. Acts of disruption of computer networks and personal computers through viruses, worms, phishing, malicious software, hardware, or programming scripts can all be forms of cyberterrorism.
Government officials and information technology (IT) security specialists have documented a significant increase in network problems and server scams since early 2001. In the United States there is an increasing concern from agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).


=== Cyberextortion ===
Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to or threatened with attacks by malicious hackers, often through denial-of-service attacks. Cyber extortionists  demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and provide ""protection"". According to the FBI, cyber extortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling their ability to operate, and demanding payments to restore their service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI, and many go unreported in order to keep the victim's name out of the public domain. Perpetrators often use a distributed denial-of-service attack. However, other cyberextortion techniques exist, such as doxing and bug poaching. An example of cyberextortion was the Sony Hack of 2014.


=== Ransomware ===

Ransomware is a type of malware used in cyberextortion to restrict access to files, sometimes threatening permanent data erasure unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware is a global issue: 153 countries were affected by this type of attack in 2024.The number of attacks is constantly growing, with 5,263 attacks in 2024.  And this is the number of large and successful attacks with serious consequences, the total number of attacks and attempted attacks, including in automatic mode in 2021 amounted to more than 300 million attacks worldwide. Nearly a third of the major attacks (1,424) in 2024 targeted industrial enterprises (up 15% by 2023), affecting critical infrastructure and services, causing severe losses. In some cases, attacks on medical facilities also resulted in human casualties. Between 2016 and 2021 ransomware caused the deaths of between 42 and 67 patients Medicare due to the treatment difficulties created, in 2024 an attack on UK pathology provider Synnovis resulted in thousands of surgeries and appointments being canceled. Ransom amounts in attacks are also continuously and significantly increasing. According to the 2022 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report, in 2021, the average ransom demand in Norton cases was $2.2 million (up 144%), and the number of victims whose personal data ended up in the dark web's information dumps increased by 85%. Losses in 2021 and 2022 are nearly $400 million. In 2024, the average ransom amount is $5.2 million, with the two largest ransoms demanded from healthcare organizations - $100 million from India's Regional Cancer Center (RCC) and $50 million from Synnovis.


=== Cybersex trafficking ===

Cybersex trafficking is the transportation of victims for such purposes as coerced prostitution or the live streaming of coerced sexual acts or rape on webcam. Victims are abducted, threatened, or deceived and transferred to ""cybersex dens"". The dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have a computer, tablet, or phone with an internet connection. Perpetrators use social media networks, video conferences, dating pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites, and other platforms. They use online payment systems and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities. Millions of reports of cybersex incidents are sent to authorities annually. New legislation and police procedures are needed to combat this type of cybercrime.
There are an estimated 6.3 million victims of cybersex trafficking, according to a recent report by the International Labour Organization. This number includes about 1.7 million child victims. An example of cybersex trafficking is the 2018–2020 Nth room case in South Korea.


=== Cyberwarfare ===

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, cyberspace has emerged as an arena for national-security threats through several recent events of geostrategic importance, including the attack on Estonia's infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers. In August 2008, Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks against Georgia. Fearing that such attacks may become a normal part of future warfare among nation-states, military commanders see a need to develop cyberspace operations.


=== Computers as a tool ===

When an individual is the target of cybercrime, the computer is often the tool rather than the target. These crimes, which typically exploit human weaknesses, usually do not require much technical expertise. These are the types of crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world. Criminals have simply been given a tool that increases their pool of potential victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehend.
Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include:

Fraud and identity theft (although this increasingly uses malware, hacking or phishing, making it an example of ""computer as target"" as well as ""computer as tool"")
Information warfare
Phishing scams
Spam
Propagation of illegal, obscene, or offensive content, including harassment and threats
The unsolicited sending of bulk email for commercial purposes (spam) is unlawful in some jurisdictions.
Phishing is mostly propagated via email. Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by malware. Or they may contain links to fake online banking or other websites used to steal private account information.


=== Obscene or offensive content ===
The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, obscene, or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some instances, it may be illegal. What content is unlawful varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs.
One area of internet pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography, which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world.


=== Ad-fraud ===

Ad-frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals, as such frauds are lucrative and unlikely to be prosecuted. Jean-Loup Richet, a professor at the Sorbonne Business School, classified the large variety of ad-frauds committed by cybercriminals into three categories: identity fraud, attribution fraud, and ad-fraud services.
Identity fraud aims to impersonate real users and inflate audience numbers. The techniques used for identity fraud include traffic from bots (coming from a hosting company, a data center, or compromised devices); cookie stuffing; falsification of user characteristics, such as location and browser type; fake social traffic (misleading users on social networks into visiting the advertised website); and fake social media accounts that make a bot appear legitimate.
Attribution fraud impersonates the activities of real users, such as clicks and conversations. Many ad-fraud techniques belong to this category: the use of hijacked and malware-infected devices as part of a botnet; click farms (companies where low-wage employees are paid to click or engage in conversations); incentivized browsing; video placement abuse (delivered in display banner slots); hidden ads (which will never be viewed by real users); domain spoofing (ads served on a fake website); and clickjacking, in which the user is forced to click on an ad.
Ad-fraud services include all online infrastructure and hosting services that might be needed to undertake identity or attribution fraud. Services can involve the creation of spam websites (fake networks of websites that provide artificial backlinks); link building services; hosting services; or fake and scam pages impersonating a famous brand.


=== Online harassment ===

Whereas content may be offensive in a non-specific way, harassment directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals, often focusing on gender, race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation.
Committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence. For example, in the case of United States v. Neil Scott Kramer, the defendant was given an enhanced sentence according to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §2G1.3(b)(3) for his use of a cell phone to ""persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct."" Kramer appealed the sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue this point, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term ""computer"" means ""an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device.""
In the United States, at least 41 states have passed laws and regulations that regard extreme online harassment as a criminal act. These acts can also be prosecuted on the federal level, because of US Code 18 Section 2261A, which states that using computers to threaten or harass can lead to a sentence of up to 20 years.
Several countries besides the US have also created laws to combat online harassment. In China, a country with over 20 percent of the world's internet users, in response to the Human Flesh Search Engine bullying incident, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council passed a strict law against cyberbullying. The United Kingdom passed the Malicious Communications Act, which states that sending messages or letters electronically that the government deems ""indecent or grossly offensive"" and/or language intended to cause ""distress and anxiety"" can lead to a prison sentence of six months and a potentially large fine.  Australia, while not directly addressing the issue of harassment, includes most forms of online harassment under the Criminal Code Act of 1995. Using telecommunication to send threats, harass, or cause offense is a direct violation of this act.
Although freedom of speech is protected by law in most democratic societies, it does not include all types of speech. Spoken or written threats can be criminalized because they harm or intimidate. This applies to online or network-related threats.
Cyberbullying has increased drastically with the growing popularity of online social networking. As of January 2020, 44 percent of adult internet users in the United States had ""personally experienced online harassment"". Online harassment of children often has negative and even life-threatening effects. According to a 2021 survey, 41 percent of children develop social anxiety, 37 percent develop depression, and 26 percent have suicidal thoughts.
The United Arab Emirates was found to have purchased the NSO Group's mobile spyware Pegasus for mass surveillance and a campaign of harassment of prominent activists and journalists, including Ahmed Mansoor, Princess Latifa, Princess Haya, and others. Ghada Owais was one of the many high-profile female journalists and activists who were targeted. She filed a lawsuit against UAE ruler Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with other defendants, accusing them of sharing her photos online.


=== Drug trafficking ===
Darknet markets are used to buy and sell controlled substances online. Some drug traffickers use encrypted messaging tools to communicate with drug mules or potential customers. The dark web site Silk Road, which started operations in 2011, was the first major online marketplace for drugs. It was permanently shut down in October 2013 by the FBI and Europol. After Silk Road 2.0 went down, Silk Road 3 Reloaded emerged. However, it was just an older marketplace named Diabolus Market that used the Silk Road name in order to get more exposure from the Silk Road brand's earlier success.
Darknet markets have had a rise in traffic in recent years for many reasons, such as the anonymous purchases and often a system of reviews by other buyers. There are many ways in which darknet markets can financially drain individuals. Vendors and customers alike go to great lengths to keep their identities a secret while online. Commonly used tools for hiding their online presence include virtual private networks (VPNs), Tails, and the Tor Browser. Darknet markets entice customers by making them feel comfortable. Although people can easily gain access to a Tor browser, actually gaining access to an illicit market is not as simple as typing it in on a search engine, as one would with Google. Darknet markets have special links that change frequently, ending in .onion as opposed to the typical .com, .net, and .org domain extensions. To add to privacy, the most prevalent currencies on these markets are Bitcoin and Monero, which allows transactions to be anonymous.
A problem that marketplace users sometimes face is exit scamming. In cases of individual vendors, a vendor with a high rating acts as if they are selling on the market and has users pay for products they never receive. The vendor then closes their account after receiving money from multiple buyers and never sending what was paid for. Any vendor on a darknet market, all of which are involved in illegal activities, has no reason not to engage in exit scamming when they no longer want to be a vendor. In 2019, an entire market known as Wall Street Market allegedly exit scammed, stealing $30 million dollars in bitcoin. 
The FBI has cracked down on these markets. In July 2017, the FBI seized one of the biggest markets, commonly called Alphabay, which re-opened in August 2021 under the control of DeSnake, one of the original administrators. Investigators pose as buyers and order products from darknet vendors in the hope that the vendors leave a trail the investigators can follow. In one case an investigator posed as a firearms seller, and for six months people purchased from them and provided home addresses. The FBI was able to make over a dozen arrests during this six-month investigation. Another crackdown targeted vendors selling fentanyl and opiates. With thousands of people dying each year due to drug overdose, investigators have made internet drug sales a priority. Many vendors do not realize the extra criminal charges that go along with selling drugs online, such as money laundering and illegal use of the mail. In 2019, a vendor was sentenced to 10 years in prison after selling cocaine and methamphetamine under the name JetSetLife. But despite the large amount of time investigators spend tracking down people, in 2018 only 65 suspects who bought and sold illegal goods on some of the biggest markets were identified. Meanwhile, thousands of transactions take place daily on these markets.


== Notable incidents ==
One of the highest-profile banking computer crimes occurred over a course of three years beginning in 1970. The chief teller at the Park Avenue branch of New York's Union Dime Savings Bank embezzled over $1.5 million from hundreds of accounts.
In 2014, the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack not only exposed sensitive company data but also led to extortion demands, marking one of the most publicized corporate cyberattacks to date.
A hacking group called MOD (Masters of Deception) allegedly stole passwords and technical data from Pacific Bell, Nynex, and other telephone companies as well as several big credit agencies and two major universities. The damage caused was extensive; one company, Southwestern Bell, suffered losses of $370,000.
In 1983, a 19-year-old UCLA student used his PC to break into a Defense Department International Communications system.
Between 1995 and 1998 the Newscorp satellite pay-to-view encrypted SKY-TV service was hacked several times during an ongoing technological arms race between a pan-European hacking group and Newscorp. The original motivation of the hackers was to watch Star Trek reruns in Germany, which was something which Newscorp did not have the copyright permission to allow.
On 26 March 1999, the Melissa worm infected a document on a victim's computer, then automatically emailed that document and a copy of the virus to other people.
In February 2000, an individual going by the alias of MafiaBoy began a series of denial-of-service attacks against high-profile websites, including Yahoo!, Dell, Inc., E*TRADE, eBay, and CNN. About 50 computers at Stanford University, along with computers at the University of California at Santa Barbara, were among the zombie computers sending pings in the distributed denial-of-service attacks. On 3 August 2000, Canadian federal prosecutors charged MafiaBoy with 54 counts of illegal access to computers.
The Stuxnet worm corrupted SCADA microprocessors, particularly the types used in Siemens centrifuge controllers.
The Russian Business Network (RBN) was registered as an internet site in 2006. Initially, much of its activity was legitimate. But apparently the founders soon discovered that it was more profitable to host illegitimate activities and to offer its services to criminals. The RBN has been described by VeriSign as ""the baddest of the bad"". It provides web hosting services and internet access to all kinds of criminal and objectionable activities that earn up to $150 million in one year. It specializes in personal identity theft for resale. It is the originator of MPack and an alleged operator of the now defunct Storm botnet.
On 2 March 2010, Spanish investigators arrested three men suspected of infecting over 13 million computers around the world. The botnet of infected computers included PCs inside more than half of the Fortune 1000 companies and more than 40 major banks, according to investigators.
In August 2010, the US Department of Homeland Security shut down the international pedophile ring Dreamboard. The website had approximately 600 members and may have distributed up to 123 terabytes of child pornography (roughly equivalent to 16,000 DVDs). To date this is the single largest US prosecution of an international child pornography ring; 52 arrests were made worldwide.
In January 2012, Zappos.com experienced a security breach compromising the credit card numbers, personal information, and billing and shipping addresses of as many as 24 million customers.
In June 2012, LinkedIn and eHarmony were attacked, and 65 million password hashes were compromised. Thirty thousand passwords were cracked, and 1.5 million eHarmony passwords were posted online.
In December 2012, the Wells Fargo website experienced a denial-of-service attack that potentially compromised 70 million customers and 8.5 million active viewers. Other banks thought to be compromised included Bank of America, J. P. Morgan, U.S. Bank, and PNC Financial Services.
On 23 April 2013, the Twitter account of the Associated Press was hacked. The hacker posted a hoax tweet about fictitious attacks on the White House that they claimed left then-President Obama injured. The hoax tweet resulted in a brief plunge of 130 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the removal of $136 billion from the S&P 500 index, and the temporary suspension of AP's Twitter account. The Dow Jones later restored its session gains.
In May 2017, 74 countries logged a ransomware cybercrime called ""WannaCry"".
Illicit access to camera sensors, microphone sensors, phonebook contacts, all internet-enabled apps, and metadata of mobile telephones running Android and iOS was reportedly provided by Israeli spyware that was found to be in operation in at least 46 nation-states around the world. Journalists, royalty, and government officials were among the targets. Earlier accusations that Israeli weapons companies were meddling in international telephony and smartphones have been eclipsed by the 2018 Pegasus spyware revelations.
In December 2019, US intelligence officials and The New York Times revealed that ToTok, a messaging application widely used in the United Arab Emirates, is a spying tool for the UAE. An investigation revealed that the Emirati government was attempting to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound, and image of those who installed the app on their phones.
On February 5, 2025, La Razon reported the arrest of a young man known as 'Natohub' who is suspected of hacking and selling information from Spanish government computer systems, NATO, United Nations, U.S. Army and other international computer systems from his home in Alicante, Spain.


== Combating computer crime ==
Due to cybercriminals using the internet for cross-border attacks and crimes, the process of prosecuting cybercriminals has been difficult. The number of vulnerabilities that a cybercriminal could use as points of opportunity to exploit has also increased over the years. From 2008 to 2014 alone, there has been a 17.75% increase in vulnerabilities across all online devices. The internet's expansive reach causes the damage inflicted to people to be magnified since many methods of cybercrime have the opportunity to reach many people. The availability of virtual spaces has allowed cybercrime to become an everyday occurrence. In 2018, the Internet Crime Complaint Center received 351,937 complaints of cybercrime, which led to $2.7 billion lost.


=== Investigation ===
In a criminal investigation, a computer can be a source of evidence (see digital forensics). Even when a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes, it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a logfile. In many countries, Internet Service Providers are required by law to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time.
There are many ways for cybercrime to take place, and investigations tend to start with an IP Address trace; however, that does not necessarily enable detectives to solve a case. Different types of high-tech crime may also include elements of low-tech crime, and vice versa, making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law enforcement. Methods of cybercrime detective work are dynamic and constantly improving, whether in closed police units or in the framework of international cooperation.

In the United States, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are government agencies that combat cybercrime. The FBI has trained agents and analysts in cybercrime placed in their field offices and headquarters. In the DHS, the Secret Service has a Cyber Intelligence Section that works to target financial cybercrimes. They combat international cybercrime and work to protect institutions such as banks from intrusions and information breaches. Based in Alabama, the Secret Service and the Alabama Office of Prosecution Services work together to train professionals in law enforcement at the National Computer Forensic Institute. The NCFI provides ""state and local members of the law enforcement community with training in cyber incident response, investigation, and forensic examination in cyber incident response, investigation, and forensic examination.""
Investigating cyber crime within the United States and globally often requires partnerships. Within the United States, cyber crime may be investigated by law enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security, among other federal agencies. However, as the world becomes more dependent on technology, cyber attacks and cyber crime are going to expand as threat actors will continue to exploit weaknesses in protection and existing vulnerabilities to achieve their end goals, often being data theft or exfiltration. To combat cybercrime, the United States Secret Service maintains an Electronic Crimes Task Force which extends beyond the United States as it helps to locate threat actors that are located globally and performing cyber related crimes within the United States. The Secret Service is also responsible for the National Computer Forensic Institute which allows law enforcement and people of the court to receive cyber training and information on how to combat cyber crime. The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for the Cyber Crimes Center (C3) providing cyber crime related services for federal, state, local and international agencies. Finally, the United States also has resources relating to Law Enforcement Cyber Incident Reporting to allow local and state agencies to understand how, when, and what should be reported as a cyber incident to the federal government.
Because cybercriminals commonly use encryption and other techniques to hide their identity and location, it can be difficult to trace a perpetrator after a crime is committed, so prevention measures are crucial.


=== Prevention ===
The Department of Homeland Security also instituted the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program. The CDM Program monitors and secures government networks by tracking network risks and informing system personnel so that they can take action. In an attempt to catch intrusions before the damage is done, the DHS created the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS). The Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency approves the private partners that provide intrusion detection and prevention services through the ECS.
Cybersecurity professionals have been skeptical of prevention-focused strategies. The mode of use of cybersecurity products has also been called into question. Shuman Ghosemajumder has argued that individual companies using a combination of products for security is not a scalable approach and has advocated for the use of cybersecurity technology primarily at the platform level. Law enforcement agencies often struggle with applying traditional policing methods to digital crimes, which evolve faster than investigative practices.
On a personal level, there are some strategies available to defend against cybercrime:

Keeping your software and operating system update to benefit from security patches
Using anti-virus software that can detect and remove malicious threats
Use strong passwords with a variety of characters that aren't easy to guess
Refrain from opening attachments from spam emails
Do not click on links from scam emails
Do not give out personal information over the internet unless you can verify that the destination is safe
Contact companies about suspicious requests of your information


=== Legislation ===
Because of weak laws, cybercriminals operating from developing countries can often evade detection and prosecution. In countries such as the Philippines, laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent. Cybercriminals can then strike from across international borders and remain undetected. Even when identified, these criminals can typically avoid being extradited to a country such as the US that has laws that allow for prosecution. For this reason, agencies such as the FBI have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals. For example, two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time. The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle, Washington. They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company. Upon completion of the interview, the suspects were arrested. Clever tricks like that are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak laws and limited international cooperation make it impossible otherwise.
The first cyber related law in the United States was the Privacy Act of 1974 which was only required for federal agencies to follow to ensure privacy and protection of personally identifiable information (PII). However, since 1974, in the United States other laws and regulations have been drafted and implemented, but there is still a gap in responding to current cyber related crime. The most recent cyber related law, according to NIST, was the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act, which came out in 2018, and provides guidelines to small businesses to ensure that cybersecurity risks are being identified and addressed accurately.
During President Barack Obama's presidency three cybersecurity related bills were signed into order in December 2014. The first was the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, the second was the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014, and the third was the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. Although the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 was just an update of an older version of the act, it focused on the practices federal agencies were to abide by relating to cybersecurity. While the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 was aimed toward increasing the amount of information sharing that occurs across the federal and private sector to improve cybersecurity amongst the industries. Finally, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 relates to cybersecurity research and education.
In April 2015, then-President Barack Obama released an executive order that allows the US to freeze the assets of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the United States.
The European Union adopted cybercrime directive 2013/40/EU, which was elaborated upon in the Council of Europe's Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.
It is not only the US and the European Union that have been introducing measures against cybercrime. On 31 May 2017, China announced that its new cybersecurity law was taking effect.
In Australia, legislation to combat cybercrime includes the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Telecommunications Act 1997, and the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.


=== Penalties ===
Penalties for computer-related crimes in New York State can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a Class A misdemeanor, such as unauthorized use of a computer, up to 3 to 15 years in prison for a Class C felony, such as computer tampering in the first degree.
However, some former cybercriminals have been hired as information security experts by private companies due to their inside knowledge of computer crime, a phenomenon which theoretically could create perverse incentives. A possible counter to this is for courts to ban convicted hackers from using the internet or computers, even after they have been released from prison – though as computers and the internet become more and more central to everyday life, this type of punishment becomes more and more draconian. Nuanced approaches have been developed that manage cyber offenders' behavior without resorting to total computer or internet bans. These approaches involve restricting individuals to specific devices which are subject to monitoring or searches by probation or parole officers. A 2023 GAO report noted that the United States lacks coordination and sufficient resources to effectively counter growing cybercrime threats.


=== Awareness ===
Cybercrime is becoming more of a threat in our society. According to Accenture's State of Cybersecurity, security attacks increased 31% from 2020 to 2021. The number of attacks per company increased from 206 to 270. Due to this rising threat, the importance of raising awareness about measures to protect information and the tactics criminals use to steal that information is paramount. However, despite cybercrime becoming a mounting problem, many people are not aware of the severity of this problem. This could be attributed to a lack of experience and knowledge of technological issues. There are 1.5 million cyber-attacks annually, which means that there are over 4,000 attacks a day, 170 attacks every hour, or nearly three attacks every minute, with studies showing that only 16 percent of victims had asked the people who were carrying out the attacks to stop. Comparitech's 2023 study shows that cybercrime victims have peaked to 71 million annually, which means there is a cyberattack every 39 seconds. Anybody who uses the internet for any reason can be a victim, which is why it is important to be aware of how to be protected while online.


=== Intelligence ===
As cybercrime proliferated, a professional ecosystem evolved to support individuals and groups seeking to profit from cybercrime activities. The ecosystem has become quite specialized, and includes malware developers, botnet operators, professional cybercrime groups, groups specializing in the sale of stolen content, and so forth. A few of the leading cybersecurity companies have the skills and resources to follow the activities of these individuals and groups. A wide variety of information that can be used for defensive purposes is available from these sources, for example, technical indicators such as hashes of infected files and malicious IPs/URLs, as well as strategic information profiling the goals and techniques of the profiled groups. Much of it is freely available, but consistent, ongoing access typically requires a subscription. Some in the corporate sector see a crucial role for artificial intelligence in the future development of cybersecurity.
Interpol's Cyber Fusion Center began a collaboration with key cybersecurity players to distribute information on the latest online scams, cyber threats, and risks to internet users. Since 2017, reports on social engineering frauds, ransomware, phishing, and other attacks have been distributed to security agencies in over 150 countries.


=== Spread of cybercrime ===
The increasing prevalence of cybercrime has resulted in more attention to computer crime detection and prosecution.
Hacking has become less complex as hacking communities disseminate their knowledge through the internet. Blogs and social networks have contributed substantially to information sharing, so that beginners can benefit from older hackers' knowledge and advice.
Furthermore, hacking is cheaper than ever. Before the cloud computing era, in order to spam or scam, one needed a variety of resources, such as a dedicated server; skills in server management, network configuration, and network maintenance; and knowledge of internet service provider standards. By comparison, a software-as-a-service for mail is a scalable and inexpensive bulk e-mail-sending service for marketing purposes that could be easily set up for spam. Cloud computing could help cybercriminals leverage their attacks, whether brute-forcing a password, improving the reach of a botnet, or facilitating a spamming campaign.

"An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and is a common confidence trick. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster claims will be used to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim to pay or simply disappears.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that ""An advance fee scheme occurs when the victim pays money to someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value – such as a loan, contract, investment, or gift – and then receives little or nothing in return."" There are many variations of this type of scam, including the Nigerian prince scam, also known as a 419 scam. The number ""419"" refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud and the charges and penalties for such offenders. The scam has been used with fax and traditional mail and is now prevalent in online communications such as emails. Other variations include the Spanish Prisoner scam and the black money scam.
Although Nigeria is most often the nation referred to in these scams, they mainly originate in other nations. Other nations known to have a high incidence of advance-fee fraud include Ivory Coast, Togo, South Africa, the Netherlands, Spain, and Jamaica.


== History ==
The modern scam is similar to the Spanish Prisoner scam that dates back to the late 18th century. In that con, businessmen were contacted by an individual allegedly trying to smuggle someone who is connected to a wealthy family out of a prison in Spain. The scammer promised to share money with the victim in exchange for a small amount of money to bribe prison guards.
One variant of the scam may date back to the 18th or 19th century, as a very similar letter, entitled ""The Letter from Jerusalem"". This is illustrated in the memoirs of Eugène François Vidocq, a former French criminal and private investigator. Another variant of the scam, dating back to ca. 1830, appears very similar to emails today: ""Sir, you will doubtlessly be astonished to be receiving a letter from a person unknown to you, who is about to ask a favour from you..."" and goes on to talk of a casket containing 16,000 francs in gold and the diamonds of a late marchioness.
The modern-day transnational scam can be traced back to Germany in 1922 and became popular during the 1980s. There are many variants of the template letter. One of these, sent via postal mail, was addressed to a woman's husband to inquire about his health. It then asked what to do with profits from a $24.6 million investment and ended with a telephone number.
Other official-looking letters were sent from a writer who said he was a director of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. He said he wanted to transfer $20 million to the recipient's bank account—money that was budgeted but was never spent. In exchange for transferring the funds out of Nigeria, the recipient would keep 30% of the total. To get the process started, the scammer asked for a few sheets of the company's letterhead, bank account numbers, and other personal information. Yet other variants have involved mention of a Nigerian prince or other member of a royal family seeking to transfer large sums of money out of the country—thus, these scams are sometimes called ""Nigerian Prince emails"".
The spread of e-mail and email harvesting software significantly lowered the cost of sending scam letters by using the Internet in lieu of international post. Although Nigeria is most often the nation referred to in these scams, they may originate in other nations as well. For example, in 2007, the head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission stated that scam emails more frequently originated in African countries or in Eastern Europe. Within the European Union, there is a high incidence of advance-fee fraud in the Netherlands and Spain.
The emails sent invariably feature a large number of implausible claims, as well as numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes. According to Cormac Herley, a Microsoft researcher, ""By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible, the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select."" Responding to Herley, a director at Nigeria's National Security Adviser said that there are more non-Nigerian scammers claiming to be Nigerian, and suggested that Nigeria's reputation for corruption is part of the allure that makes scams seem more plausible.  Nigeria has a reputation for being at the center of email scamming.
Modern variations include “sugar daddy/sugar momma” schemes, some of which involve advance-fee scamming, and money flipping, whereby the mark is promised a large amount of money in exchange for sending a small amount of money.
A 2018 study of Nigerian hip-hop culture found that glamorization of cyber-fraud is prevalent in such music. Some scammers have accomplices in the United States and abroad who move in to finish the deal once the initial contact has been made.


=== Motives ===

Many scammers tend to come from poorer and more-educated backgrounds, where Internet access and better education, along with inability to afford basic necessities, drive people into committing online fraud. They could also have been influenced by social media celebrities and artists who promote scamming as a ""cool"" trend to quickly gain access to luxury items like sports cars and fashion.
In the case of Nigeria, the rise in scamming cases was due to a boom in cybercafes, a series of economic crashes from the 1980s, and the resulting joblessness among young people in Nigeria.


== Implementation ==
This scam usually begins with the perpetrator contacting the victim via email, instant messaging, or social media using a fake email address or a fake social media account. The fraudster then makes an offer that would allegedly result in a large payoff for the victim.
An email subject line may say something like ""From the desk of barrister [Name]"", ""Your assistance is needed"", ""Important"", ""Dear Sir or Madam"" and so on. The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold that they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it.
Such people, who may be real people being impersonated by the scammer or fictitious characters played by the con artist, could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a traffic accident or a plane crash (leaving no will or known next of kin), a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee, and similar characters.
The money could be in the form of gold bullion, gold dust, money in a bank account, blood diamonds, a series of cheques or bank drafts, so on and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to fifty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a small percentage do, enough to make the scam worthwhile as many millions of messages can be sent daily.
To help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents that bear official government stamps, and seals. 419 scammers also often utilize fake websites and addresses to present themselves as more legitimate. Multiple ""people"" may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls all the fictitious personae used in scams.
Once the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as ""To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?"" or ""For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more"" or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a wire transfer, and the scammer receives and pockets it.
Often but not always, delays and additional costs are added by the fraudster, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying would be covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for white-collar crime, such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the ""transaction"", as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.
Sometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the scammers' side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and mortgage a house or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in their country to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied: once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the ""deal"" through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.
The essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is that the promised money transfer to the victim never happens because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, sometimes thousands more that was borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer. The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.
During the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a ""test"" devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's gullibility; the bank account information is not used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like Western Union and MoneyGram. The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason for using such money-sending services is that such wire transfers are irreversible and often untraceable. Further, these services are ideal because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, making receipt of such funds almost or entirely anonymous. However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam before raiding any accounts that the victim did not close.
Telephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from burner phones. In Ivory Coast, a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.
The spam emails used in these scams are often sent from Internet cafés equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of Lagos, such as Festac Town, contain many cyber cafés that serve scammers; cyber cafés often lock their doors during certain times, e.g. 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.
Nigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams. After a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. There, police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank British Airways boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal money orders, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.
The ""success rate"" of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they operate illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated that he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money. If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it does not take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.
The success of advance fee crimes is based on the initial persuading of the victim. The FBI recently reported that in 2019 there were 14,607 US citizens that were victims of advance fee scams. The complaints that they received totaled in losses of more than $3.5 billion.


== Countermeasures ==

In recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced-fee fraud. In 2009, Nigeria's EFCC announced that they had adopted smart technology developed by Microsoft to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed ""Eagle Claw"", running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.
Some individuals participate in a practice known as scam baiting, in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer's time and decrease the time they have available for actual victims. Likewise, the website Artists Against 419, set-up by volunteers, offers a public database with information on scam websites. They work closely together with APWG to share their data with financial institutions and cybersecurity companies.


== Common elements ==


=== Irreversible money transfers ===
A central element of advance-fee fraud is that the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, could successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who could track the accounts used by the scammer.
Wire transfers via Western Union and MoneyGram are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's cheques, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. 


=== Anonymous communication ===
Since the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.


==== Web-based email ====
Because many free email services do not require valid identifying information and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address (Gmail being a common choice), making the scammer's country of origin more difficult to trace. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.


==== Email hijacking/friend scams ====
Some fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. For instance, with social engineering, the fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them. A variety of techniques such as phishing, keyloggers, and computer viruses are used to gain login information for the email address.


==== Fax transmissions ====
Facsimile machines are commonly used tools of business whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like FedEx Office/Kinko's. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.


==== SMS messages ====
Abusing SMS bulk senders such as WASPs, scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or with stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMS messages to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event and that they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically, the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a virtual telephone number.
These messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.
A contemporary (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.


==== Telecommunications relay services ====

Many scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality or gender other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use TRS, a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using TDD or other teleprinter device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.
FCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. MCI said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.
Tracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol–based relay services such as IP Relay. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.
TRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.


=== Invitation to visit the country ===
Sometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need a visa or that the scammers will provide one. If the victim does this, the scammers have the power to extort money from the victim.
Sometimes victims are ransomed, kidnapped, or murdered. According to a 1995 U.S. State Department report, over fifteen persons were murdered between 1992 and 1995 in Nigeria after following through on advance-fee frauds. In 1999 Norwegian millionaire Kjetil Moe was lured to South Africa by scammers and was murdered. George Makronalli was lured to South Africa and was killed in 2004.


== Variants ==

There are many variations on the most common stories, and also many variations on the way the scam works. Some of the more commonly seen variants involve employment scams, lottery scams, online sales and rentals, and romance scams. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as Craigslist and eBay, or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the external links section at the end of this article.


=== Employment scams ===
This scam targets people who have posted their résumés on job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a ""work permit"" for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) ""government official"" to contact. The ""government official"" then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.
Many legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior ""registration fee"", usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.
The scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a ""work-from-home"" opportunity, or asks them to cash a cheque or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a ""mystery shopper"", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as Wal-Mart. The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen cheque or money order as described above, the victim deposits it—banks will often credit an account with the value of a cheque not obviously false— and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the cheque is not honoured (""bounces"") and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on cheque cashing usually offer only a small part of the cheque's total amount, with the assurance that many more cheques will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the cheques, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.


==== Bogus job offers ====
More sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details. A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for identity theft.
Another form of employment scam involves making people attend a fake ""interview"" where they are told the benefits of the company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When ""given"" the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work for the company unpaid as a form of ""training"". Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.


=== Lottery scam ===

The lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The ""winner"" is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.
The fake cheque technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen cheque, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad cheque eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.
In 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.
Typical lottery scams address the person as some variation of Lucky Winner. This is a red flag, as if someone entered an actual lottery and won, the organization would know their name, and not simply call them Lucky Winner.


=== Online sales and rentals ===
Many scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like Craigslist, eBay, or Gumtree. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake cheque written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by money order or Western Union. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the cheque to clear, and when the bad cheque bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.
Some scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.
Sometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them. Or the con artist finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit. The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving. Once the terms are negotiated, a forged cheque is forwarded for a greater amount than negotiated, and the fraudster asks the landlord to wire some of the money back.


=== Pet scams ===
This is a variation of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are advertised as bait on online advertising websites using little real seller verification like Craigslist, Gumtree, and JunkMail. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically, the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever else an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.
By determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.
Upon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.
Numerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate may be said to be too small, and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may be said to have become sick, and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.
Additionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar the fictitious fees are to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.
Numerous scam websites may be used for this scam. This scam has been linked to the classical 419 scams in that the fictitious couriers used are also used in other types of 419 scams such as lotto scams.


=== Romance scam ===

One of the variants is the Romance Scam, a money-for-romance angle. The con artist approaches the victim on an online dating service, an instant messenger, or a social networking site. The scammer claims an interest in the victim, and posts pictures of an attractive person. The scammer uses this communication to gain confidence, then asks for money. A very common example of romance scams is depicted in the fraudulent activities of these boys, popularly known as Yahoo boys in Nigeria.
The con artist may claim to be interested in meeting the victim but needs cash to book a plane, buy a bus ticket, rent a hotel room, pay for personal-travel costs such as gasoline or a vehicle rental, or to cover other expenses. In other cases, they claim they are trapped in a foreign country and need assistance to return, to escape imprisonment by corrupt local officials, to pay for medical expenses due to an illness contracted abroad, and so on. The scammer may also use the confidence gained by the romance angle to introduce some variant of the original Nigerian Letter scheme, such as saying they need to get money or valuables out of the country and offer to share the wealth, making the request for help in leaving the country even more attractive to the victim.
Scams often involve meeting someone on an online match-making service. The scammer initiates contact with their target who is out of the area and requests money for transportation fare. Scammers will typically ask for money to be sent via a money order or wire transfer due to the need to travel, or for medical or business costs.
An extreme example of this is the case of a 67-year-old Australian woman, Jette Jacobs. In 2013, she traveled to South Africa to supposedly marry her scammer, Jesse Orowo Omokoh, 28, after having sent more than $90,000 to him over a three-year period. Her body was discovered on February 9, 2013, under mysterious circumstances, two days after meeting up with Omokoh, who then fled to Nigeria, where he was arrested. He was found to have had 32 fake online identities. Due to lack of evidence he was not charged with murder, but was charged with fraud.


=== Mobile tower installation fraud ===

This variant of advance-fee fraud is widespread in India and Pakistan. The fraudster uses Internet classified websites and print media to lure the public into installing a mobile phone tower on their property, with the promise of huge rental returns. The fraudster also creates fake websites to appear legitimate. The victims part with their money in pieces to the fraudster on account of the Government Service Tax, government clearance charges, bank charges, transportation charges, survey fee etc. The Indian government is issuing public notices in media to spread awareness among the public and warn them against mobile tower fraudsters.


=== Other scams ===
Other scams involve unclaimed property, also called ""bona vacantia"" in the United Kingdom. In England and Wales (other than the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall), this property is administered by the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor's Department. Fraudulent emails and letters claiming to be from this department have been reported, informing the recipient they are the beneficiary of a legacy but requiring the payment of a fee before sending more information or releasing the money. In the United States, messages are falsely claimed to be from the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), a real organization, but one that does not and cannot by itself make payments.
In one variant of 419 fraud, an alleged hitman writes to someone explaining he has been targeted to kill them. He tells them he knows the allegations against them are false, and asks for money so the target can receive evidence of the person who ordered the hit.
Another variant of advanced fee fraud is known as a pigeon drop. This is a confidence trick in which the mark, or ""pigeon"", is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an accomplice).
Some scammers go after the victims of previous scams; known as a reloading scam. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim for a price. Or they may say a fund has been set up by the Nigerian government to compensate victims of 419 fraud, and all that is required is proof of the loss, personal information, and a processing and handling fee. The recovery scammers obtain lists of victims by buying them from the original scammers.


== Consequences ==
Estimates of the total losses due to scams are uncertain and vary widely, since many people may be too embarrassed to admit that they were gullible enough to be scammed to report the crime. A United States government report in 2006 indicated that Americans lost $198.4 million to Internet fraud in 2006, averaging a loss of $5,100 per incident. That same year, a report in the United Kingdom claimed that these scams cost the economy £150 million per year, with the average victim losing £31,000. As of 2019, Nigerian letter scams still annually collect $700,000 ($860,901 in 2024 dollars) or $2,133 ($2,623 in 2024 dollars) per person.
In addition to the financial cost, many victims also suffer a severe emotional and psychological cost, such as losing their ability to trust people. One man from Cambridgeshire, UK burnt himself to death with petrol after realizing that the $1.2 million ""internet lottery"" that he had won was actually a scam. In 2007, a Chinese student at the University of Nottingham killed herself after she discovered that she had fallen for a similar lottery scam.
Other victims lose wealth and friends, become estranged from family members, deceive partners, get divorced, or commit criminal offenses in the process of either fulfilling their ""obligations"" to the scammers or obtaining more money. In 2008, an Oregon woman lost $400,000 to a Nigerian advance-fee fraud scam, after an email told her she had inherited money from her long-lost grandfather. Her curiosity was piqued because she actually had a grandfather with whom her family had lost touch, and whose initials matched those given in the email. She sent hundreds of thousands of dollars over a period of more than two years, despite her family, bank staff and law enforcement officials all urging her to stop. The elderly are particularly susceptible to online scams such as this, as they typically come from a generation that was more trusting, and are often too proud to report the fraud. They also may be concerned that relatives might see it as a sign of declining mental capacity, and they are afraid to lose their independence.
Victims can be enticed to borrow or embezzle money to pay the advance fees, believing that they will shortly be paid a much larger sum and be able to refund what they had misappropriated. Crimes committed by victims include credit-card fraud, check kiting, and embezzlement. San Diego–based businessman James Adler lost over $5 million in a Nigeria-based advance-fee scam. While a court affirmed that various Nigerian government officials (including a governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria) were directly or indirectly involved, and that Nigerian government officials could be sued in U.S. courts under the ""commercial activity"" exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Adler was unable to get his money back due to the doctrine of unclean hands because he had knowingly entered into a contract that was illegal.
Some 419 scams involve even more serious crimes, such as kidnapping or murder. One such case, in 2008, involves Osamai Hitomi, a Japanese businessman who was lured to Johannesburg, South Africa and kidnapped on September 26, 2008. The kidnappers took him to Alberton, south of Johannesburg, and demanded a $5 million ransom from his family. Seven people were ultimately arrested. In July 2001, Joseph Raca, a former mayor of Northampton, UK, was kidnapped by scammers in Johannesburg, South Africa, who demanded a ransom of £20,000. The captors released Raca after they became nervous. One 419 scam that ended in murder occurred in February 2003, when Jiří Pasovský, a 72-year-old scam victim from the Czech Republic, shot and killed 50-year-old Michael Lekara Wayid, an official at the Nigerian embassy in Prague, and injured another person, after the Nigerian Consul General explained he could not return the $600,000 that Pasovský had lost to a Nigerian scammer.
The international nature of the crime, combined with the fact that many victims do not want to admit that they bought into an illegal activity, has made tracking down and apprehending these criminals difficult. Furthermore, the government of Nigeria has been slow to take action, leading some investigators to believe that some Nigerian government officials are involved in some of these scams. The Nigeria government's establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in 2004 helped with the issue to some degree, although issues with corruption remain.
Despite this, there have been some recent successes in apprehending and prosecuting these criminals. In 2004, 52 suspects were arrested in Amsterdam after an extensive raid, after which almost no 419 emails were reported being sent by local internet service providers. In November 2004, Australian authorities apprehended Nick Marinellis of Sydney, the self-proclaimed head of Australian 419ers who later boasted that he had ""220 African brothers worldwide"" and that he was ""the Australian headquarters for those scams"". In 2008 US authorities in Olympia, Washington, sentenced Edna Fiedler to two years in prison with five years of supervised probation for her involvement in a $1 million Nigerian cheque scam. She had an accomplice in Lagos, Nigeria, who shipped her up to $1.1 million worth of counterfeit cheques and money orders with instructions on where to ship them.


== In popular culture ==
Research suggests that some Nigerian hip-hop musicians have strong connections with some Yahoo Boys (cybercriminals). Due to the increased use of the 419 scams on the Internet, it has been used as a plot device in many films, television shows and books. A song, ""I Go Chop Your Dollar"", performed by Nkem Owoh, also became internationally known as an anthem for 419 scammers using the phrases ""419 is just a game, I am the winner, you are the loser"". Other appearances in popular media include:

The 2018 film Nigerian Prince follows a Nigerian-American teenager sent to Nigeria by his mother, where he connects with his cousin Pius, who runs 419 scams for a living.
The 2016 short story The Nigerian Prince – When The Scammer Becomes The Scammed by L. Toshua Parker follows the true story of a U.S. college student and hacker in 2000 who targeted Nigerian 419 scammers and stole millions back from them.
In ""A Thief in Ni-Moya"", a 1981 novella from Robert Silverberg's Majipoor series, a young woman is swindled out of her savings under the pretense of fees required to inherit a large estate.

"Accounting scandals are business scandals that arise from intentional manipulation of financial statements with the disclosure of financial misdeeds by trusted executives of corporations or governments. Such misdeeds typically involve complex methods for misusing or misdirecting funds, overstating revenues, understating expenses, overstating the value of corporate assets, or underreporting the existence of liabilities; these can be detected either manually, or by means of deep learning. It involves an employee, account, or corporation itself and is misleading to investors and shareholders.
This type of ""creative accounting"" can amount to fraud, and investigations are typically launched by government oversight agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. Employees who commit accounting fraud at the request of their employers are subject to personal criminal prosecution.


== Two types of fraud ==


=== Misappropriation of assets ===
Misappropriation of assets – often called defalcation or employee fraud – occurs when an employee steals a company's asset, whether those assets are of a monetary or physical nature. Typically, assets stolen are cash, or cash equivalents, and company data or intellectual property. However, misappropriation of assets also includes taking inventory out of a facility or using company assets for personal purpose without authorization. Company assets include everything from office supplies and inventory to intellectual property.


=== Fraudulent financial reporting ===
Fraudulent financial reporting is also known as earnings management fraud. In this context, management intentionally manipulates accounting policies or accounting estimates to improve financial statements. Public and private corporations commit fraudulent financial reporting to secure investor interest or obtain bank approvals for financing, as justifications for bonuses or increased salaries or to meet the expectations of shareholders. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has brought enforcement actions against corporations for many types of fraudulent financial reporting, including improper revenue recognition, period-end stuffing, fraudulent post-closing entries, improper asset valuations, and misleading non-GAAP financial measures.


== The fraud triangle ==
The fraud triangle is a model for explaining the factors that cause someone to commit fraudulent behaviors in accounting. It consists of three components, which together, lead to fraudulent behavior:

Incentives/pressure: Management or other employees have incentives or pressures to commit fraud.
Opportunities: Circumstances provide opportunities for management or employees to commit fraud.
Attitudes/rationalization: An attitude, character, or set of ethical values exists that allows management or employees to commit a dishonest act, or they are in an environment that imposes sufficient pressure that causes them to rationalize committing a dishonest act.
Incentives/pressures: A common incentive for companies to manipulate financial statements is a decline in the company's financial prospects. Companies may also manipulate earnings to meet analysts' forecasts or benchmarks such as prior-year earnings, to meet debt covenant restrictions, achieve a bonus target based on earnings, or artificially inflate stock prices. As for the misappropriation of assets, financial pressures are a common incentive for employees. Employees with excessive financial obligations, or those with substance abuse or gambling problems may steal to meet their personal needs.
Opportunities: Although the financial statements of all companies are potentially subject to manipulation, the risk is greater for companies in industries where significant judgments and accounting estimates are involved. Turnover in accounting personnel or other deficiencies in accounting and information processes can create an opportunity for misstatement. As for misappropriation of assets, opportunities are greater in companies with accessible cash or with inventory or other valuable assets, especially if the assets are small or easily removed. A lack of controls over payments to vendors or payroll systems can allow employees to create fictitious vendors or employees and bill the company for services or time.
Attitudes/rationalization: The attitude of top management toward financial reporting is a critical risk factor in assessing the likelihood of fraudulent financial statements. If the CEO or other top managers display a significant disregard for the financial reporting process, such as consistently issuing overly optimistic forecasts, or they are overly concerned about meeting analysts' earnings forecast, fraudulent financial reporting is more likely. Similarly, for misappropriation of assets, if management cheats on customers by overcharging for goods or engaging in high-pressure sales tactics, employees may feel that it is acceptable for them to behave in the same fashion.


== Causes ==
Frauds such as embezzlement are easy to hide when company records are opaque to begin with. Poor accounting, such as the absence of monthly reconciliations or an independent audit function, also indicates vulnerability to fraud.


=== Executive and managerial motivations for fraud ===
An executive can reduce the price of his company's stock due to information asymmetry. He can: accelerate accounting of expenses, delay accounting of revenue, engage in off balance sheet transactions to make the company seem less profitable, or simply report very low estimates of future earnings. Executives may do this to make a company a more attractive takeover target. When the company is bought for less, the acquirer profits from the executive's actions to surreptitiously reduce the share price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from former shareholders to the acquirer. The executive is then rewarded with a golden handshake for presiding over the firesale that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work. Managerial opportunism plays a large role in these scandals.


=== Employee motivations for fraud ===
Not all accounting scandals are caused by those at the top. In fact, in 2015, 33% of all business bankruptcies were caused by employee theft. Often middle managers and employees are pressured to or willingly alter financial statements due to their debts or the possibility of personal benefit over that of the company, respectively.  For example, officers who would be compensated more in the short-term (for example, cash in pocket) might be more likely to report inaccurate information on a tab or invoice (enriching the company and maybe eventually getting a raise).


== List of biggest accounting scandals ==


== Notable outcomes ==
The Enron scandal turned into the indictment and criminal conviction of Big Five auditor Arthur Andersen on June 15, 2002. Although the conviction was overturned on May 31, 2005, by the Supreme Court of the United States, the firm ceased performing audits and split into multiple entities. The Enron scandal was defined as being one of the biggest audit failures of all time. The scandal included utilizing loopholes that were found within the GAAP (General Accepted Accounting Principles). For auditing a large-sized company such as Enron, the auditors were criticized for having brief meetings a few times a year that covered large amounts of material. By January 17, 2002, Enron decided to discontinue its business with Arthur Andersen, claiming they had failed in accounting advice and related documents.  Arthur Andersen was judged guilty of obstruction of justice for disposing of many emails and documents that were related to auditing Enron. Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, the firm was forced to give up its CPA licenses later in 2002, costing over 113,000 employees their jobs. Although the ruling was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, the once-proud firm's image was tarnished beyond repair, and it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.
On July 9, 2002, George W. Bush gave a speech about recent accounting scandals that had been uncovered. In spite of its stern tone, the speech did not focus on establishing new policy, but instead focused on actually enforcing current laws, which include holding CEOs and directors personally responsible for accountancy fraud.
In July 2002, WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection in what was considered at the time as the largest corporate insolvency ever. A month earlier, the company's internal auditors discovered over $3.8 billion in illicit accounting entries intended to mask WorldCom's dwindling earnings, which was by itself more than the accounting fraud uncovered at Enron less than a year earlier. Ultimately, WorldCom admitted to inflating its assets by $11 billion.
These scandals reignited the debate over the relative merits of US GAAP, which takes a ""rules-based"" approach to accounting, versus International Accounting Standards and UK GAAP, which takes a ""principles-based"" approach. The Financial Accounting Standards Board announced that it intends to introduce more principles-based standards. More radical means of accounting reform have been proposed, but so far have very little support. The debate itself overlooks the difficulties of classifying any system of knowledge, including accounting, as rules-based or principles-based. This also led to the establishment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On a lighter note, the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize in Economics went to the CEOs of those companies involved in the corporate accounting scandals of that year for ""adapting the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers for use in the business world.""
In 2003, Nortel made a big contribution to this list of scandals by incorrectly reporting a one cent per share earnings directly after their massive layoff period. They used this money to pay the top 43 managers of the company. The SEC and the Ontario Securities Commission eventually settled civil action with Nortel. A separate civil action was taken against top Nortel executives including former CEO Frank A. Dunn, Douglas C. Beatty, Michael J. Gollogly, and MaryAnne E. Pahapill and Hamilton. These proceedings were postponed pending criminal proceedings in Canada, which opened in Toronto on January 12, 2012. Crown lawyers at this fraud trial of three former Nortel Networks executives say the men defrauded the shareholders of Nortel of more than $5 million. According to the prosecutor, this was accomplished by engineering a financial loss in 2002, and a profit in 2003 thereby triggering Return to Profit bonuses of $70 million for top executives. In 2007, Dunn, Beatty, Gollogly, Pahapill, Hamilton, Craig A. Johnson, James B. Kinney, and Kenneth R.W. Taylor were charged with engaging in accounting fraud by ""manipulating reserves to manage Nortel's earnings.""
In 2005, after a scandal on insurance and mutual funds the year before, AIG was investigated for accounting fraud. The company already lost over $45 billion worth of market capitalization because of the scandal. Investigations also discovered over $1 billion worth of errors in accounting transactions. The New York Attorney General's investigation led to a $1.6 billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives. CEO Maurice R. ""Hank"" Greenberg was forced to step down and fought fraud charges until 2017, when the 91-year-old reached a $9.9 million settlement. Howard Smith, AIG's chief financial officer, also reached a settlement.
Well before Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme came to light, observers doubted whether his listed accounting firm – an unknown two-person firm in a rural area north of New York City – was competent to service a multibillion-dollar operation, especially since it had only one active accountant, David G. Friehling. Friehling's practice was so small that for years he operated out of his house; he only moved into an office when Madoff customers wanted to know more about who was auditing his accounts. Ultimately, Friehling admitted to simply rubber-stamping at least 18 years' worth of Madoff's filings with the SEC. He also revealed that he continued to audit Madoff even though he had invested a substantial amount of money with him; accountants are not allowed to audit broker-dealers with whom they are investing. He agreed to forfeit $3.18 million in accounting fees and withdrawals from his account with Madoff. His involvement makes the Madoff scheme not only the largest Ponzi scheme ever uncovered, but the largest accounting fraud in world history. The $64.8 billion claimed to be in Madoff accounts dwarfed the $11 billion fraud at WorldCom.

"Internet fraud prevention is the act of stopping various types of internet fraud. Due to the many different ways of committing fraud over the Internet, such as stolen credit cards, identity theft, phishing, and chargebacks, users of the Internet, including online merchants, financial institutions and consumers who make online purchases, must make sure to avoid or minimize the risk of falling prey to such scams. The most common cybercrimes involving the internet fraud increasingly entail the social engineering, phishing, cryptocurrency frauds, romance scams including the pig butchering scam, etc.
The speed and sophistication of the online fraudulent actors continues to grow. According to a 2017 study conducted by LexisNexis, $1.00 lost to fraud costs organizations (merchants, credit card companies and other institutions) between $2.48 to $2.82 – ""that means that fraud costs them more than roughly 2 1⁄2 times the actual loss itself.""
Three constituencies have a direct interest in preventing Internet fraud. First, there is the consumer who may be susceptible to giving away personal information in a phishing scam, or have it be acquired by rogue security software or a keylogger. In a 2012 study, McAfee found that 1 in 6 computers do not have any sort of antivirus protection, making them very easy targets for such scams. Business owners and website hosts are also engaged in the ongoing battle to ensure that the users of their services are legitimate. Websites with file hosting must work to verify uploaded files to check for viruses and spyware, while some modern browsers perform virus scans prior to saving any file (there must be a virus scanner previously installed on the system). However, most files are only found to be unclean once a user falls prey to one. Financial institutions, such as credit card companies, who refund online customers and merchants who have been defrauded also have a strong interest in mitigating Internet fraud risk.


== History ==
Internet fraud began appearing in 1994 with the start of e-commerce. The first trend to be seen was the use of ""Famous Names"" to commit the fraud. Using this method, the person committing the fraud would use stolen credit cards with the popular celebrity of the time's name. This highly unsophisticated plan was only successful because the internet was new and the possibility of fraud had not been considered. Eventually internet merchants implemented rules to confirm the card user name.
Following the ""Famous Names"" strategies were more technical attacks in which hackers created card-generator applications that came with real credit card numbers. Attacks such as these were commonly targeted toward the same vendor. Merchants had no way to see cross-merchant activity until the credit card associations reported it. After 1996 fraudulent users went on the internet to test the status of stolen credit cards.
By 1998, the internet was filled with e-commerce sites. Fraudsters began to set up ""dummy"" merchant sites where they could harvest their own credit cards through their own site. Before the charge-backs rolled in, they would shut the doors of the website and leave the country. Soon a trend started of the mass theft of identities from the internet through information provided online under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the counter-methods merchants developed was the use of consumer accounts. The merchant would set up a consumer account the first time the consumer made a purchase. Following the creation of the new account, the merchant would perform a series of third-party checks to validate the information provided by the consumer.
As auction sites like eBay and uBid gained popularity, new fraud methods arrived specifically targeting this new merchant community. From selling bogus goods to misleading the consumer, the fraudsters continued to take advantage of consumers.


== Credit card fraud ==
Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of a credit card to make a transaction. This fraud can range from using the credit card to obtain goods without actually paying, or performing transactions that were not authorized by the card holder. Credit card fraud is a serious offense, and punished under the charge of identity theft. The majority of this type of fraud occurs with counterfeit credit cards, or using cards that were lost or stolen. Approximately .01% of all transactions are deemed fraudulent, and approximately 10% of Americans have reported some type of credit card fraud in their lifetimes.
While many systems are in place by the card provider to identify fraud, the card holder is left with the ultimate responsibility. Preemptive steps to reduce chances of fraud include installing anti-virus software, keeping and maintaining current records, and reviewing statements and charges regularly. The objective is to provide a first defense in spotting fraudulent charges. Exercising caution on online sites, especially suspicious or non-established sites, as well as in foreign countries is also advisable. The legitimacy of websites should be verified. Checking with the Better Business Bureau is a first step to see how that company has established themselves. Once on a website, the user can check what security or encryption software the website utilizes. A padlock to the left of the URL, can sometimes be found to signify additional security is being implemented. A physical address for the company, or sending an email to one of the contact addresses can further verify the reliability of the company. Even on trusted sites, it is important to be diligent that one has not navigated away from that site.  Other safe practices include being cautious of account number distribution, keeping credit cards separate from a wallet or purse, keeping constant sight of credit cards, and drawing lines on blank spaces above the total on receipts. On accounts in which one has saved card information, it is important to have a strong password with a mix of numbers and symbols. Using different passwords for different sites, is also strongly encouraged.
If a card is lost or stolen, the card holder must report it immediately, even if no fraud has been detected yet. Once a card is reported lost or stolen, the card-holder is not responsible for erroneous charges.


== Identity theft ==
Identity theft, also called identity fraud, is a crime in which someone steals and uses another person's personal information and data without permission. It is a crime usually committed for economic gain. Stolen personal data includes Social Security Number's (SSN), passport numbers, or credit card numbers, which can easily be used by another person for profit. It is a serious crime that can have negative effects on a person's finances, credit score and reputation.
There are three specific types of identity theft aside from the broad term. Tax-related identity theft is when a criminal uses someone else's SSN to get a tax refund or a job. Victim of this type of theft must contact the IRS. Child identity theft is when a criminal uses a child's SSN to apply for governmental benefits, open bank accounts, or apply for a loan. Medical identity theft is when a criminal uses someone else's name or health insurance to see a doctor, get a prescription or other various medical needs.
Fortunately, there are precautions that consumers can take to prevent identity theft. There are simple ways in which to avoid becoming a victim of identity fraud and an easy way to remember them is the acronym SCAM. SCAM reminds us to 1. Be stingy when giving out personal information to others 2. Check financial information regularly and recognize when something strange has occurred 3. Ask for a copy of your credit report often, and 4. Maintain careful financial records. It is necessary to be aware of phishing and to always be cautious of giving your personal information out through e-mail, website or over the phone. Also be sure that the phone number, name and mailing address registered to your bank account is all correct as there are cases in which bank statements have been sent to false addresses and identities have been stolen. Check these bank statements regularly and be sure that there are no charges to your account that you do not recognize.
Individuals experiencing identity theft can take immediate steps to limit the damage to their finances and personal life. The first step is to contact one of the three national credit reporting companies and place an initial fraud alert. This is done by contacting a national credit reporting company, asking them to put a fraud alert on your credit file, and confirming that they will notify the other two companies of this change. The next step is to order free credit reports from each of the three national credit reporting companies. Lastly, report the identity theft to the FTC and print an FTC identity theft affidavit and then file a police report and ask for a copy of the report.


== Phishing ==
Phishing is a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information which the scammer (phisher) can use illicitly. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware.  Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. There are four main type of phishing techniques: link manipulation, filter evasion, website forgery, and phone phishing. Legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures are all attempts to control the growing number of phishing attacks. The damage caused by phishing ranges from denial of access to email to substantial financial loss. It is estimated that between May 2004 and May 2005, approximately 1.2 million computer users in the United States suffered losses caused by phishing, totaling approximately US$929 million. United States businesses lose an estimated US$2 billion per year as their clients become victims.
As early as 2007, the adoption of anti-phishing strategies by businesses needing to protect personal and financial information was low. There are several different techniques to combat phishing, including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing. These techniques include steps that can be taken by individuals, as well as by organizations. One strategy for combating phishing is to train people to recognize phishing attempts, and to deal with them. Education can be effective, especially where training provides direct feedback. People can take steps to avoid phishing attempts by slightly modifying their browsing habits. When contacted about an account needing to be ""verified"" (or any other topic used by phishers), it is a sensible precaution to contact the company from which the email apparently originates to check that the email is legitimate. Alternatively, the address that the individual knows is the company's genuine website can be typed into the address bar of the browser, rather than trusting any hyperlinks in the suspected phishing message.
Nearly all legitimate e-mail messages from companies to their customers contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. It is up to the customer to use his or her discretion to separate genuine emails from phishing emails and prevent phishing attacks. The Anti-Phishing Working Group, an industry and law enforcement association, has suggested that conventional phishing techniques could become obsolete in the future as people are increasingly aware of the social engineering techniques used by phishers. They predict that pharming and other uses of malware will become more common tools for stealing information.


== Chargebacks ==
A chargeback is not necessarily a fraudulent activity. In its most basic sense, a chargeback is when an issuing bank, a bank where consumers acquire credit cards, reverses a prior charge from a bank account or credit card at the request of a cardholder because there was a problem with a transaction. The problem could be anything from a situation where the consumer did not receive the product they purchased, to one where the cardholder was not satisfied with the quality of the product, to a situation where the cardholder was a victim of identity theft. The concept of a chargeback rose as a measure of consumer protection taken by issuing banks and credit card companies. Chargebacks were a measure to protect cardholders from identity theft and the unauthorized transitions from identity theft. Chargebacks also provide incentive to producers and sellers to provide products of consistent quality and efficient customer service.
With the rise of technology, and the resulting increase in online and telephone transactions and commerce, it has become easier to commit fraud via chargebacks. Chargebacks are an interesting concept because the process protects consumers from identity theft fraud, but opens the door for consumers to commit chargeback fraud. Chargeback fraud is also known as ""friendly fraud."" Friendly fraud is the term for when a consumer authorizes a transaction for an online purchase on his or her credit card, receives the product or products the consumer paid for, but then later the same consumer files for a chargeback. The fraudulent filing for a chargeback results in a consumer keeping and avoiding paying for the products they ordered.
There are several common cases where a consumer commits so called friendly fraud. One situation is where the consumer claims that they never received the purchase or order when in reality, they did. In this scenario, when a customer files a chargeback, it enables the customer to keep the product while not paying for the product. Another situation is where a customer claims that the product they received was either defective or damaged. In this scenario, a chargeback claim facilitates the customer to get a ""two for one"" deal because the producer will ship a replacement product. Finally, another common situation is where the customer buys a product, but then files a chargeback with their issuing bank claiming they never authorized such a transaction.
Producers and merchants have responded to the rise of fraudulent chargeback claims and have implemented measures to combat friendly fraud. Chargeback fraud is challenging because the vendor's first reaction is to tighten internal fraud controls and add anti-fraud software tools. While this reduces fraud, it also prevents many legitimate customers from completing online purchases.  In addition, it is difficult for merchants to protect against friendly fraud chargebacks because the chargeback process often favors the consumers over the producers. One of the best ways to prevent friendly fraudsters is for online merchants to require signatures for the delivered packages upon their arrival. This will provide very specific information to the producers about the delivery. The drawback to signature confirmation is that it increases shipping costs, which still hurt producers' bottom line. In addition, producers have started to share data of lists of customers who make chargeback claims. This helps producers see trends of customer's shopping habits. This transfer of information among producers helps them maximize profits and forces consumers to stay honest. Producers have also started keeping a record of all communication with customers, so customers who want to file fraudulent chargebacks have a harder time following through with the claim. Finally, e-commerce sites have started to keep track of customer's IP addresses, so when consumers make a claim that they did not make a purchase, it is much harder to lie.
Although chargeback fraud is a problem with the growth of e-commerce and other alternative shopping outlets with dishonest consumers, many consumers who file chargeback claims are honest and have encountered a real problem with their transaction. In some cases, chargebacks can be reduced by implementing more refined tracking tools to measure reasons for returns and employing more live customer service personnel and improving their training.


== FBI response ==
In May 2001, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI, Thomas T. Kubic, gave a testimony to the House Committee on the Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection on the FBI's response to Internet fraud crimes. Alongside the U.S. Postal Inspection Services, U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigative Division, and the United States Secret Service, the FBI has developed the ""Operation Cyber Loss"" program to combat Internet fraud. The agency also created the Internet Fraud Complaint Center (IFCC) to help with the operation. The types of fraud that Operation Cyber Loss is investigating are identity theft, on-line auction fraud, credit/debit card fraud, investment and securities fraud, Ponzi/Pyramid schemes, and non-delivery of merchandise purchased over the Internet.


== Mitigating the risk of internet fraud ==
Businesses selling goods and services online bear a large portion of internet fraud costs—according to the 2017 LexisNexis study, fraud costs as a percentage of revenues for online retail (physical goods) and eCommerce (digital goods) are 2.17% and 2.39% respectively, with online gift card fraud being an area of special concern.
Relying on fraud detection software alone has been found to flag too many legitimate transactions as fraudulent: online purchases are either blocked outright or delayed for review such that the customer abandons the purchase. One approach that has been found successful in reducing the number of ""false positives"" while still reducing fraud is a ""layered"" filtering. This technique employs fraud detection software based on algorithms and AI/machine learning, combined with manual review by customer service personnel. Real-time fraud detection supplied by software-as-a-service (SaaS) fraud detection firms includes verifying CVV, PIN/signature, check verification, browser malware detection, address verification, device ID fingerprinting, geolocation, authentication by quizzes, cross-checking shared data bases of customer profiles, automated transaction scoring, rules-based filters and other data points.
In response to the prevalence of online fraud, many fraud detection and prevention software service companies have entered the field, employing a variety of techniques, including machine-learning-based behavior analytics and anomaly detection; the use of a ""fraud hub"" that enables third-party data sources to feed in purchaser information that is used in predictive statistical modeling; and automated remote malware detection. The largest players in this area are Cybersource (owned by Visa), Brighterion (Mastercard), and SAS Institute. Some of the newcomers in the field include Fraudio, Signifyd, Eye4Fraud, Kount, Riskified, Sift Science, Forter and Feedzai.

Reviews on the latest Internet Fraud (Awareness against scams)"
"A romance scam is a confidence trick involving feigning romantic intentions towards a victim, gaining the victim's affection, and then using that goodwill to get the victim to send money to the scammer under false pretenses or to commit fraud against the victim.  Fraudulent acts may involve access to the victim's money, bank accounts, credit cards, passports, Cash App, e-mail accounts, or national identification numbers; or forcing the victims to commit financial fraud on their behalf. These scams are often perpetrated by the fraud factory operated by the organized criminal gangs, who work together to take money from multiple victims at a time. Pig butchering scam (PBS or PB Scam) is increasingly rampant and widespread type of romance scam which usually also entail the high-yield investment program (HYIP) scam.
Scams can be detected and prevented with the simple precautions.   More money is lost each year to romance scams than to similar internet scams, such as technical support scams.


== Modus operandi ==
The mode of scam, which has several variations, usually works on the following script.

Romance scammers create personal profiles using stolen photographs of attractive people for the purpose of asking others to contact them. This is often known as catfishing.  Often photos of unknown actresses or models will be used to lure the victim into believing they are talking to that person.  US military members are also impersonated, as pretending to serve in the military explains why the scammer is not available for an in-person meeting.
Because the scammers often look nothing like the photos they send to the victims, the scammers rarely meet the victims face to face or even in a video call.  They deceive their intended victims by making plausible-sounding excuses about their unwillingness to show their faces, such as by saying that they cannot meet yet because they are temporarily traveling or have a broken web camera.


=== Tricking the victim ===
Scammers are very adept at knowing how to ""play"" their victims – sending love poems, sex games in emails, building up a ""loving relationship"" with many promises of ""one day we will be married"". Scammers ask their victims many questions, but share little about themselves. They often shower the victims with compliments.
Communications are exchanged between the scammer and victim over a period of time, sometimes months or even an entire year, until the scammer feels they have connected with the victim enough to ask for money.  Scammers prey on the victims' false sense of a relationship to lure them into sending money.
These requests may be for gas money, bus or airplane tickets to visit the victim, medical or education expenses. There is usually the promise the scammer will one day join the victim in the victim's home.
Victims may be invited to travel to the scammer's country; in some cases the victims arrive with asked-for gift money for family members or bribes for corrupt officials, only to be beaten and robbed or murdered.
The scam usually ends when the victim realizes they are being scammed or stops sending money. However, people are often slow to believe the reality, and the stigma of falling for such the deception may deter them from reporting the fraud to the police.  Many victims, even when confronted with strong evidence, cannot bring themselves to believe that the person who seems so loving in text messages is instead a criminal scammer.  They may react angrily or violently against anyone who objects.  Banks can lock down the victim's money, especially when financial abuse of an elder is suspected.


=== Criminal groups ===
Criminal networks defraud lonely people around the world with false promises of love and romance. Scammers post profiles on dating websites, non-dating social media accounts, classified sites and even online forums to search for new victims. The scammer usually attempts to obtain a more private method of communication, such as an email or phone number, to build trust with the victim.
Because the scammers are working in groups, someone in the group can be online and available to send e-mail or text messages to the victim at any hour.  The rotation between different scammers, all claiming to be the same person, is difficult to detect in text-based messages, whereas it would be obvious if a different person showed up for a face-to-face meeting or in a video or telephone call.


== Scale ==


=== Australia ===
According to the Australian government, the crime has also been in the rise in that country.  Monetary loss in Australia rose from $20.5 million to $28.6 million from 2017 to 2019. SCAMwatch, a website run by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC), provides information about how to recognise, avoid and report scams. In 2005, the ACCC and other agencies formed the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce (ACFT). The site provides information about current scams, warning signs and staying safe online.


=== United Kingdom ===
According to UK Finance, romance scams were the fastest growing category of cybercrime in the United Kingdom in 2023, increasing by a third from 2022 to a total loss of £93m.


=== United States ===
In 2023, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation received reports of more than US $650 million being lost by victims of relationship scams. This was approximately seven times what was stolen through phishing scams and almost 100 times the reported losses from ransomware attacks.
According to FBI IC3 statistics, the crime has been at an alarming rise. Monetary loss in the United States rose from $211 million to $475 million from 2017 to 2019. The number of cases of reported romance scams rose from 15,372 to 19,473 in those two years.
""The FTC estimated on average $2,500 was sent to romance scammers in 2020, more than ten times the median loss across all fraud types. Given the rampant use of social media and rise of online dating services, the opportunity for scammers to prey on individuals is only growing, explained Emma Fletcher, an analyst at the FTC.
""To be able to make that connection and do it remotely is something that may not have been possible a decade ago, but it's very much possible and socially quite common now for people to make love connections online and they're taking advantage of that,"" Fletcher said.""


== Target demographics ==

Many victims are in their 40s to mid-60s, seeking a companion. Elderly people are often targeted, because they are more likely to have assets, such as retirement funds or homes, that can be stolen.  Victims tend to have an unmet emotional need for companionship, as well as a desire for greater economic security and a lack of purpose in life.
Sensitive people are more vulnerable to online dating scams, based on a study conducted by the British Psychological Society. According to their results, sensitive and less emotionally intelligent people are more likely to be vulnerable to online dating scams.
Some people are serial victims: even after one scam is uncovered, they are still susceptible and will fall for another scammer with a different story.


== Variations ==
Narratives used to extract money from the victims of romance scams include the following:

Saying their boss has paid them in postal money orders, and asks the victim to cash the forged money orders and then wire money to the scammer. The bank eventually reverts the money order cash but not the wire transfer.
Saying they need the victim to send money to pay for a passport.
Saying they require money for flights to the victim's country because they are being held back in their home country by a family member or spouse. In all cases the scammer never comes, or instead says that they are being held against their will by immigration authorities who are demanding bribes.
Saying they have had gold bars or other valuables seized by customs and need to pay taxes to them before they can recover their items and join the victim in their country.
Saying they need money to join the victim in his or her country, after meeting on an online dating site.
Saying they are being held against their will for failure to pay a bill.
Saying they need money to pay hospital bills.
Saying they need the money to pay their phone bills in order to continue communicating with the victim.
Saying they need the money for their own or their parents' urgent medical treatment.
The scammer actually is employed directly or indirectly by a website, with a share of the victim's member or usage fees passed on to the scammer.
Sometimes the scammers do not explicitly ask the victim for money, but instead coerce them to receive packages (often purchased by the scammers with stolen credit cards) and forward the items to Nigeria.


=== Pig butchering scam ===

In pig butchering scams, scammers will first contact and attempt to gain trust with victims- often with elaborate fake identities presenting as attractive and preying on a victim's desire for companionship. Scammers will then introduce a seemingly profitable cryptocurrency investment opportunity that they encourage victims to make increasing investments into. Finally, once a substantial amount is collected or when victims try to collect funds, the scammer will become unreachable to the victim, leaving them with no way to recover funds.
Many of the perpetrators are also victims lured from abroad under false pretenses and then forced to commit the fraud by organized crime gangs.


=== Blackmail ===
Some romance scammers seek out a victim with an obscure fetish and will make the victim think that if they pay for the scammer's plane ticket, they will get to live out their sexual fantasy with the scammer. Other scammers like to entice victims to perform sexual acts on webcam. They then record their victims, play back the recorded images or videos to them, and then extort money to prevent them from sending the recordings to friends, family, or employers, often discovered via social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter.


=== Pro-daters ===
The pro-dater differs from other scams in method of operation: a face-to-face meeting actually does take place in the scammer's country but for the sole purpose of manipulating the victim into spending as much money as possible in relatively little time, with little or nothing in return. The scheme usually involves accomplices, such as an interpreter or a taxi driver, each of whom must be paid by the victim at an inflated price. Everything is pre-arranged so that the wealthy foreigner pays for expensive accommodation, is taken not to an ordinary public café but to a costly restaurant (usually some out-of-the-way place priced far above what locals would ever be willing to pay), and is manipulated into making various expensive purchases, including gifts for the scammer such as electronics and fur coats.
The vendors are also typically part of the scheme. After the victim has left, the merchandise is returned to the vendors and the pro-dater and their various accomplices take their respective cut of the take. As the pro-dater is eager to date again, the next date is immediately set up with the next wealthy foreigner.
The supposed relationship goes no further, except to inundate the victim with requests for more money after they return home. Unlike a gold digger, who marries for money, a pro-dater is not necessarily single or available in real life.


=== 419 scams ===

Another variation of the romance scam is when the scammer insists they need to marry in order to inherit millions of dollars of gold left by a father, uncle, or grandfather. A young woman will contact a victim and tell him of her plight: not being able to remove the gold from her country as she is unable to pay the duty or marriage taxes. The woman will be unable to inherit the fortune until she gets married, the marriage being a prerequisite of the father, uncle or grandfather's will.
The scammer convinces their victim they are sincere until they are able to build up enough of a rapport to ask for thousands of dollars to help bring the gold into the victim's country. The scammer will offer to fly to the victim's country to prove they are a real person so the victim will send money for the flight. However, the scammer never arrives. The victim will contact the scammer to ask what happened, and the scammer will provide an excuse such as not being able to get an exit visa, or an illness, theirs or a family member.


=== Impersonation of military personnel ===
A rapidly growing technique scammers use is to impersonate American military personnel. Scammers prefer to use the images, names and profiles of soldiers as this usually inspires confidence, trust and admiration in their victims. Military public relations often post information on soldiers without mentioning their families or personal lives, so images are stolen from these websites by organized Internet crime gangs often operating out of Nigeria or Ghana.
These scammers tell their victims they are lonely, or supporting an orphanage with their own money, or needing financial assistance because they cannot access their own money in a combat zone. The money is always sent to a third party to be collected for the scammer. Sometimes the third party is real, sometimes fictitious. Funds sent by Western Union and MoneyGram do not have to be claimed by showing identification if the sender sends money using a secret pass phrase and response. The money can be picked up anywhere in the world. Some scammers may request Bitcoin as an alternative payment method.


=== eWhoring ===
In eWhoring, a scammer uses a collection of stolen nude or explicit photos to impersonate a specific person to sell more photos and video to a victim, entice them into sending money for promised dates, cam sessions, or in-person meet-ups, or to distribute phishing links. The original photo sets may originally have been consensually shared by the person being impersonated, or can be the result of revenge porn, hacks or other theft. As with other Romance scams, reports of eWhoring grew dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic.
Impersonation can range from outright fraud to more complicated practices like chat teams, in which the person in the photos may hire a third-party or chat team to impersonate them through direct messages, selling photos to fans directly. In response to concerns over impersonation, potential victims may request specific photos with proof that it is actually them, such as holding a specific object or writing a specific message on a piece of paper. In May 2023, the adult subscription site My.Club instituted a ""No Fake Creators"" policy, and announced that every person using the platform to sell photos, videos or conversation would be required to undergo identity verification, including facial scanning, each time they logged onto the platform.

"A click farm is a form of click fraud where a large group of low-paid workers are hired to click on links or buttons for the click fraudster (click farm  master or click farmer). The workers click the links, surf the target website for a period of time, and possibly sign up for newsletters prior to clicking another link. For many of these workers, clicking on enough ads per day may increase their revenue substantially and may also be an alternative to other types of work. It is extremely difficult for an automated filter to detect this simulated traffic as fake because the visitor behavior appears exactly the same as that of an actual legitimate visitor.
Fake likes or reviews generating from click farms are essentially different from those arising from bots, where computer programs are written by software experts.  To deal with such issues, companies such as Facebook are trying to create algorithms that seek to wipe out accounts with unusual activity (e.g. liking too many pages in a short period of time).


== Logistics ==
Click farms are usually located in developing countries, such as China, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. The business of click farms extends to generating likes and followers on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and more. Workers are paid, on average, one US dollar for a thousand likes or for following a thousand people on Twitter. Then click farms turn around and sell their likes and followers at a much higher price.
In Thailand in June 2017, a click farm was discovered with hundreds of mobile phones and several hundred thousand SIM cards used to build up likes and views on WeChat.
As well as inflating engagement on social media, click farms are used for click fraud and ad fraud practices. This includes inflating the clicks and traffic on websites so that publishers can collect a fraudulent payout. This same traffic can also be hired to damage the paid ad campaigns of business rivals, known as competitor click fraud.
Click farms have also been used to increase the views on everything from Spotify, Twitch and YouTube to creating fake reviews for businesses, products or services.
Many click farms advertise openly on the internet, usually masquerading as genuine traffic sources.
The need for click farming arises because, as The Guardian states, ""31% will check ratings and reviews, including likes and Twitter followers, before they choose to buy something."" This shows the increasing importance that businesses, celebrities and other organisations put on the number of likes and followers they have. This creates monetary values for likes and followers, which means that businesses and celebrities feel compelled to increase their likes to create a positive online profile.
Pay-per-click providers, including Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, have made substantial efforts to combat click fraud. Automated filters remove most  click fraud attempts at the source. Deanna Yick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-based Google, said that “we design our systems to catch bot-related attacks.” “Because a significant amount of malicious traffic is automated, advertisers are protected from these kinds of attacks.” she added. In an effort to circumvent these filtering systems, click fraudsters have begun to use these click farms to mimic actual visitors.


== Implications ==
Engagement rate, a performance metric that measures the quality of social media activity such as Facebook likes or Twitter retweets, can be interpreted in terms of ""engagement per follower,"" measured by dividing the raw counts of social media activity by the number of followers. Users who engage in short term click farms services will see their engagement rate plummet in time as the initial increase in the volume of social media activity drops when the click farms services end, coupled with the increase in fake followers if not the same.
Italian security researchers and bloggers Andrea Stroppa and Carla De Micheli found out in 2013 that $40 million to $360 million to date were earned from the sale of and the potential benefits of buying fake Twitter followers. $200 million a year is also earned from fake Facebook activities. About 40 to 80 percent of Facebook advertisements are bought on a pay-per-click basis. Advertisers have claimed that about 20 percent of Facebook clicks are invalid, and they had tried to seek refunds. This could cost Facebook $2.5 billion of their 2014 revenue.
Some companies have tried to mitigate the effects of click farming. Coca-Cola made its 2010 Super Bowl advert ""Hard Times"" private after learning it was shared on Shareyt and issued a statement that it ""did not approve of fake fans."" Hasbro was alerted to an online casino, a sub-licensee of its Monopoly brand, had added fake Facebook likes and hence contacted Facebook to remove the site. Hasbro issued a statement that it was “appalled to hear of what had occurred” and claimed no previous knowledge of the page.
Although click farm services violate many social media user policies, there are no government regulations that render them illegal. However, Sam DeSilva, a lawyer specializing in IT and outsourcing law at Manches LLP in Oxford had mentioned that: ""Potentially, a number of laws are being breached – the consumer protection and unfair trading regulations. Effectively, it's misleading the individual consumers.""


== Advertising provider responses ==
Facebook issued a statement stating: ""A like that doesn't come from someone truly interested in connecting with the brand benefits no one. If you run a Facebook page and someone offers you a boost in your fan count in return for money, our advice is to walk away – not least because it is against our rules and there is a good chance those likes will be deleted by our automatic systems. We investigate and monitor ""like-vendors"" and if we find that they are selling fake likes, or generating conversations from fake profiles, we will quickly block them from our platform."" Andrea Faville reported that Alphabet Inc. companies Google and YouTube ""take action against bad actors that seek to game our systems."" LinkedIn spokesman Doug Madey said buying connections ""dilutes the member experience, violates their user agreement, and can also prompt account closures.""  Chief executive and founder of Instagram, Kevin Systrom reports ""We've been deactivating spammy accounts from Instagram on an ongoing basis to improve your experience.""
Facebook's purging of fake likes and accounts occurred from August to September 2012. According to Facebook's 2014 financial report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, an estimated 83 million false accounts were deleted, accounting for approximately 6.4% of the 1.3 billion total accounts on Facebook. Likester reported pages affected include Lady Gaga, who lost 65,505 fans and Facebook, who lost 124,919 fake likes. Technology giant Dell lost 107,889 likes (2.87% of its total likes) in 24 hours. Billions of YouTube video fake views were deleted after being exposed by auditors. In December 2014, Instagram carried out a purge deemed the ""Instagram Rapture"" wherein many accounts were affected—including Instagram's own account, which lost 18,880,211 followers.
Recent research has indicated that click farms, as well as stand-alone bots, have become easy to identify by the defenses of an ad network, while more sophisticated techniques are still being studied and examined by researchers.

"Ad fraud (also referred to as click fraud or PPC fraud) is concerned with the practice of fraudulently representing online advertisement impressions, clicks, conversion or data events in order to generate revenue. Ad-frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals.
While ad fraud is frequently associated with banner ads, video ads and in-app ads, click fraud has been associated with search marketing, mobile advertising and conversion fraud with affiliate marketing. AppsFlyer estimates financial exposure to app install fraud in Q1 of 2018 was as much as $800 million. 
Ad fraud is the categorical term inclusive of all forms of online advertising fraud. A successful ad-fraud campaign generally involves a sophisticated combination of Identity fraud and attribution fraud: for instance, sending fake traffic through bots using fake social accounts and falsified cookies; bots will click on the ads available on a scam page that is faking a famous brand. In 2004 Google's CFO George Reyes said that fraud is the biggest threat to internet economy with the first research paper covering the topic in 1999 or earlier. In 2016 World Federation of Advertisers published its first guidance on Ad fraud to advise its members on how to counter the problem allegedly eating close to US$20 billion of its members ad budgets in 2015.
Recent research has revealed new insights into ad fraud within search engine marketing. A study conducted in 2023 found that the average rate of fraudulent activities in search engine advertisements is approximately 11.5%. This statistic highlights the growing importance of implementing effective fraud protection measures in search engine marketing to combat ad fraud. In 2024, the share of malvertising increased by 10%, with 70% of users distrusting online advertising. The cost of fraud in digital advertising globally was $88 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $172 billion by 2028.


== Comparison with other Cybercrime ==
In a 2017 report Juniper Research estimates ad fraud to be worth US$19 billion equivalent to $51 million per day. This figure, representing advertising on online and mobile devices, will continue to rise, reaching $44 billion by 2022. Ad fraud is the #1 cybercrime in terms of revenue, ahead of Tax-refund fraud. HP Enterprise in its Business of Hacking report highlighted ad fraud as the easiest and the most lucrative form of Cybercrime.

== Types of mobile ad fraud ==

Online advertising fraud is a leading concern amongst almost 50% of mobile marketers according to a report from iotec. Ad measurement and verification vendor TrafficGuard reports 7 different types of mobile ad fraud across 2 different categories:


== Sourced Traffic ==
In a recent publication by Association of National Advertisers sourced traffic was reported as a notable form of ad fraud, a practice where companies partaking in the formal online advertising market buy fraudulent traffic to resell it as legitimate. Sourced traffic has been mistakenly referred to as arbitrage, because buying Sourced traffic does not have any potential for return where as in financial markets arbitrage refers to ""risk-free"" trading of legitimate assets. While there is no evidence to support the claim, and such evidence would be impossible to conclusively gather, it may be that Sourced Traffic represents lion's share of the Ad fraud market due to the ease and popularity of acquiring and reselling it. The only evidence-based study to Sourced Traffic found in 2016 that around 50% of the acquired traffic was originating from data center IP addresses and that selected Ad Fraud verification vendors Integral Ad Science and Moat largely failed to detect it as ad fraud. The report also showed how easy it is to acquired Sourced traffic as low as $0.001 per click, a price in stark contrast to the going price for click in the formal market which is typically $1 or more.


== Non-profit activity ==
In 2016 there were four notable non-profit organizations focused on creating awareness and availability of resources for countering ad fraud: Botlab, JiCWEBS, Media Rating Council (MRC), and Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG). Each have published various guidelines and commentaries on ad fraud, most notable of which is the Media Rating Council's Invalid Traffic Detection Guidelines.

"Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack in which the attacker collects stolen account credentials, typically consisting of lists of usernames or email addresses and the corresponding passwords (often from a data breach), and then uses the credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on other systems through large-scale automated login requests directed against a web application. Unlike credential cracking, credential stuffing attacks do not attempt to use brute force or guess any passwords – the attacker simply automates the logins for a large number  (thousands to millions) of previously discovered credential pairs using standard web automation tools such as Selenium, cURL, PhantomJS or tools designed specifically for these types of attacks, such as Sentry MBA, SNIPR, STORM, Blackbullet and Openbullet.
Credential stuffing attacks are possible because many users reuse the same username/password combination across multiple sites, with one survey reporting that 81% of users have reused a password across two or more sites and 25% of users use the same passwords across a majority of their accounts. In 2017, the FTC issued an advisory suggesting specific actions companies needed to take against credential stuffing, such as insisting on secure passwords and guarding against attacks. According to former Google click fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder, credential stuffing attacks have up to a 2% login success rate, meaning that one million stolen credentials can take over 20,000 accounts. Wired magazine described the best way to protect against credential stuffing is to use unique passwords on accounts, such as those generated automatically by a password manager, enable two-factor authentication, and to have companies detect and stop credential stuffing attacks.


== Credential spills ==
A credential spill, alternatively referred to as a data breach or leak, arises when unauthorized individuals or groups illicitly obtain access to sensitive user credentials that organizations store. Such credentials frequently comprise usernames, email addresses, and passwords. The repercussions of credential spills can be significant, as they commonly subject users to a range of hazards, including identity theft, financial fraud, and unauthorized account infiltration.
Credential stuffing attacks are considered among the top threats for web and mobile applications as a result of the volume of credential spills. More than three billion credentials were spilled through online data breaches in 2016 alone.


== Origin ==
The term was coined by Sumit Agarwal, co-founder of Shape Security, who was serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon at the time.


== Incidents ==
On 20 August 2018, U.K. health and beauty retailer Superdrug was targeted with an attempted blackmail, with hackers showing purported evidence that they had penetrated the company's site and downloaded 20,000 users' records. The evidence was most likely obtained from hacks and spillages and then used as the source for credential stuffing attacks to glean information to create the bogus evidence.
In October and November 2016, attackers gained access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber (Uber BV and Uber UK) developers, using employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches. The hackers claimed to have hijacked 12 employees' user accounts using the credential-stuffing method, as email addresses and passwords had been reused on other platforms. Multi-factor authentication, though available, was not activated for the affected accounts. The hackers located credentials for the company's AWS datastore in the repository files, which they used to obtain access to the records of 32 million non-US users and 3.7 million non-US drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 S3 buckets. The attackers alerted Uber, demanding payment of $100,000 to agree to delete the data. The company paid through a bug bounty program but did not disclose the incident to affected parties for more than a year. After the breach came to light, the company was fined £385,000 (reduced to £308,000) by the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office.
In 2019 Cybersecurity research firm Knight Lion Security claimed in a report that credential stuffing was favored attack method for GnosticPlayers.


== Compromised credential checking ==
Compromised credential checking is a technique enabling users to be notified when passwords are breached by websites, web browsers or password extensions.
In February 2018, British computer scientist Junade Ali created a communication protocol (using k-anonymity and cryptographic hashing) to anonymously verify whether a password was leaked without fully disclosing the searched password. This protocol was implemented as a public API and is now consumed by multiple websites and services, including password managers and browser extensions. This approach was later replicated by Google's Password Checkup feature. Ali worked with academics at Cornell University to develop new versions of the protocol known as Frequency Smoothing Bucketization (FSB) and Identifier-Based Bucketization (IDB). In March 2020, cryptographic padding was added to the protocol.

"The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is a U.S. insurance industry trade association focused on preventing, detecting and defeating insurance fraud and vehicle theft through information analysis, investigations, training, legislative advocacy and public awareness. 
NICB's headquarters are in Oak Brook, Illinois.  
Much of NICB's focus is on motor vehicle theft. It has advocated for better insurance fraud statutes in the criminal codes drafted by state legislatures. Tools and reports the NICB provides to combat car theft include VINCheck, ""a free lookup service provided to the public to assist in determining if a vehicle may have a record of an insurance theft claim"", a Report Fraud hotline, and two reports: Hot Wheels, which lists the most commonly stolen vehicles; and Hot Spots, the locations across the United States where auto thefts are most common.


== History ==
NICB was formed in 1992 by a merger of the National Automobile Theft Bureau (NATB) and the Insurance Crime Prevention Institute (ICPI), both of which were not-for-profit organizations. NATB, founded in the early 20th century, managed vehicle theft investigations and developed vehicle theft databases for use by the insurance industry. ICPI investigated insurance fraud for approximately 20 years before joining with the NATB to form the National Insurance Crime Bureau.  
NICB is supported by more than 1,100 property and casualty insurance companies and self-insured companies dedicated to combating insurance fraud and crime.

"Cryptocurrency and crime describe notable examples of cybercrime related to theft (or the otherwise illegal acquisition) of cryptocurrencies and some methods or security vulnerabilities commonly exploited. Cryptojacking is a form of cybercrime specific to cryptocurrencies used on websites to hijack a victim's resources and use them for hashing and mining cryptocurrency.
According to blockchain analysis company Chainalysis, around US$2.5 billion was laundered through Bitcoin between 2009 and 2018, and the fraction of cryptocurrency transactions linked to illicit activities has been on the rise since early 2019. In 2021, 0.15% of known cryptocurrency transactions conducted were involved in illicit activities like cybercrime, money laundering and terrorism financing, representing a total of $14 billion. The FBI estimated that crypto fraud costs American investors $4.8 billion in 2023.


== Background ==

There are various types of cryptocurrency wallets available, with different layers of security, including devices, software for different operating systems or browsers, and offline wallets.
Novel exploits unique to blockchain transactions exist, and aim to generate unintended outcomes for those involved. One of the more well-known issues that open the possibility for exploits on Bitcoin is the transaction malleability problem.
The Immunefi Crypto Losses 2022 Report lists industry losses from frauds and hacking as a combined total of US$3.9 billion for the year, and US$8 billion for 2021.
Despite increasingly strict regulations in the US and Europe, Crypto Crime continues to rise, with losses in early 2025 already exceeding $502 million, according to Bitrace’s Crypto Crime Report 2025. Hacks account for 63% of these losses, with phishing and rug pulls also contributing significantly, particularly on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Tornado Cash. Criminals are using ever more sophisticated methods, including smart contract attacks and deepfake scams. While some crypto exchanges are strengthening compliance and transparency, such as Coinbase and PayPal’s collaboration on stablecoins, others still overlook suspicious transactions. New regulations are pushing companies to tighten Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, but criminals keep exploiting loopholes. For investors, vigilance remains crucial. Thorough research, secure wallets, and skepticism toward offers that seem too good to be true are essential as crypto crime becomes increasingly professionalized.


== Notable thefts ==
In 2018, around US$1.7 billion in cryptocurrency was lost to scams, theft and fraud. In the first quarter of 2019, such losses rose to US$1.2 billion. 2022 was a record year for cryptocurrency theft, according to Chainalysis, with US$3.8 billion stolen worldwide during 125 system hacks, including US$1.7 billion stolen by ""North Korea-linked hackers"".


=== Exchanges ===
Notable cryptocurrency exchange compromises resulting in the loss of cryptocurrencies include:

Between 2011 and 2014, US$350 million worth of bitcoin was stolen from Mt. Gox.

On December 2, 2021, users of the BadgerDAO DeFi lost around $118,500,000 worth of bitcoin and $679,000 worth of ethereum tokens in a front-end attack. A compromised API key of the Cloudflare content delivery network account allowed the injecting of a malicious script into the web interface. BadgerDAO ""paused"" all smart contracts due to user complaints.
On December 6, 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitmart lost around $135M worth of Ethereum and an estimated $46 million in other cryptocurrencies due to a breach of two of its wallets. Although BitMart stated that it would reimburse its clients, many BitMart clients have not received any money from the exchange as of January 2022.
On December 12, 2021, users of VulcanForge lost around $135M worth of PYR due to breaches of multiple wallets. Partnering centralized exchanges had been notified of the hack and they have pledged to seize any stolen funds upon deposit.
On January 27, 2022, Qubit Finance (DeFi) lost around $80M worth of Binance Coin due to a flaw in the smart contract that enabled the withdrawal of the said amount in exchange for a deposit of 0 ETH.
In March 2022, the largest cryptocurrency theft of the year, US$625 million in ether and USD coin was stolen from the Ronin Network. Hacked nodes were finally discovered when a user reported being unable to withdraw funds. The heist was later linked to Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed hacking collective, by the U.S. Treasury Department.
On September 20, 2022, Wintermute was hacked resulting in theft of US$160 million. The company attributed the vulnerability to a service used by the platform that generates vanity addresses for digital accounts.
On September 25, 2023, it was reported that $200 million was stolen by hackers from Hong Kong-based crypto firm Mixin Network. The company suspended deposits and withdrawals, stating that the database of its network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers resulting in the loss of the assets.
On February 21, 2025 the exchange Bybit reported the theft of $1.5 billion in ether, estimated at the time to be the largest crypto heist in history. A blockchain analysis firm linked the attack to the Lazarus Group which exploited security features transferring the money to multiply unidentified addresses
On June 17, 2025 it was reported that there was cyberattack on Iran's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex. The attack was done during the Iran–Israel War. The attack, blamed on the Israel-linked hacker group Gonjeshke Darande (also called ""Predatory Sparrow""), led to the theft of more than $90 million in digital assets, mostly Tether (USDT) on the Tron network.


=== Wallets ===
The Parity Wallet has had two security incidents amounting to 666,773 ETH lost or stolen. In July 2017, due to a bug in the multi-signature code, 153,037 ETH (approximately US$32 million at the time) were stolen. In November 2017, a subsequent multisignature flaw in Parity made 513,774 ETH (about US$150 million) unreachable; as of March 2019, the funds were still frozen.


=== Energy ===
Notable cases of electricity theft to mine proof-of-work cryptocurrencies include:

In February 2021 Malaysian police arrested six men involved in a Bitcoin mining operation which had stolen US$2 million in electricity
Ukraine authorities shut down an underground gaming and cryptocurrency farm in July 2021, accused of stealing $259,300 of electricity each month
In July 2021 Malaysian authorities destroyed 1,069 cryptocurrency mining systems accused of stealing electricity from the grid
In May 2021 UK authorities closed a suspected bitcoin mine after Western Power Distribution found an illegal connection to the electricity supply

==== Bitcoin ====
There have been many cases of bitcoin theft. As of December 2017, around 980,000 bitcoins—over five percent of all bitcoin in circulation—had been lost on cryptocurrency exchanges.
One type of theft involves a third party accessing the private key to a victim's bitcoin address, or an online wallet. If the private key is stolen, all the bitcoins from the compromised address can be transferred. In that case, the network does not have any provisions to identify the thief, block further transactions of those stolen bitcoins, or return them to the legitimate owner.
Theft also occurs at sites where bitcoins are used to purchase illicit goods. In late November 2013, an estimated US$100 million in bitcoins were allegedly stolen from the online illicit goods marketplace Sheep Marketplace, which immediately closed. Users tracked the coins as they were processed and converted to cash, but no funds were recovered and no culprits were identified. A different black market, Silk Road 2, stated that during a February 2014 hack, bitcoins valued at $2.7 million were taken from escrow accounts.
Sites where users exchange bitcoins for cash or store them in ""wallets"" are also targets for theft. Inputs.io, an Australian wallet service, was hacked twice in October 2013 and lost more than $1 million in bitcoins. GBL, a Chinese bitcoin trading platform, suddenly shut down on 26 October 2013; subscribers, unable to log in, lost up to $5 million worth of bitcoin. In late February 2014 Mt. Gox, one of the largest virtual currency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo amid reports that bitcoins worth US$350 million had been stolen. Flexcoin, a bitcoin storage specialist based in Alberta, Canada, shut down in March 2014 after saying it discovered a theft of about $650,000 in bitcoins. Poloniex, a digital currency exchange, reported in March 2014 that it lost bitcoins valued at around $50,000. In January 2015 UK-based bitstamp, the third busiest bitcoin exchange globally was hacked and US$5 million in bitcoins were stolen. In February 2015, a Chinese exchange named BTER lost bitcoins worth nearly $2 million to hackers.
A major bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, was compromised by the 2016 Bitfinex hack, when nearly 120,000 bitcoins (around US$71 million) were stolen in 2016. Bitfinex was forced to suspend its trading. The theft was the second-largest bitcoin heist ever, dwarfed only by the Mt. Gox theft in 2014. According to Forbes, ""All of Bitfinex's customers... will stand to lose money. The company has announced a cut of 36.067% across the board."" Following the hack the company failed to refund customers, though efforts are continuing. In 2022, the US government recovered 94,636 bitcoin (worth approximately $3.6 billion at the time of recovery) from the 2016 thefts of the Bitfinex exchange, reported as the ""largest financial seizure"" in U.S. history. By February 2022, the amount of bitcoin stolen in 2016 had increased in value to $4.5 billion. Two people were arrested for the thefts in 2022; married couple Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and rapper Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States.
On May 7, 2019, hackers stole over 7000 Bitcoins from the Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange, at a value of over 40 million US dollars. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng stated: ""The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses, and other attacks... The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time.""
Thefts have raised safety concerns. Charles Hayter, founder of the digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare said, ""It's a reminder of the fragility of the infrastructure in such a nascent industry."" According to the hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business on April 2, 2014, ""these vendors lack regulatory oversight, minimum capital standards and don't provide consumer protection against loss or theft.""
Japan and the United States have accused North Korean hackers of stealing cryptocurrency worth over $300 million from the Japan-based exchange DMM Bitcoin. The theft was attributed to the TraderTraitor group, believed to be part of the Lazarus Group, which is allegedly linked to North Korean authorities. The incident occurred in late May 2024, involving the theft of 4,502.9 Bitcoin. The theft involved the hackers using social engineering tactics to impersonate a recruiter on LinkedIn and send a malicious pre-employment test to an employee at a crypto wallet software company. This allowed them to compromise the employee's system and manipulate a legitimate transaction request from DMM, resulting in the loss of 4,502.9 Bitcoin. The FBI and Japan's National Police Agency are collaborating to combat North Korea's cybercrime activities, which date back to the mid-1990s and include a cyber-warfare unit known as Bureau 121. The Lazarus Group has previously gained notoriety for its involvement in high-profile hacks, including the attack on Sony Pictures in retaliation for the film ""The Interview.""


==== Ethereum ====

In June 2016, hackers exploited a vulnerability in The DAO to steal US$50 million. Subsequently, the currency was forked into Ethereum Classic, and Ethereum, with the latter continuing with the new blockchain without the exploited translations.
On November 21, 2017, Tether announced that it had been hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from its core treasury wallet. The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making them unspendable).
In 2022, hackers created a signature account on a blockchain bridge called ""Wormhole"" and stole more than $300 million worth of ether.


== Fraud ==


=== Exit scams and Ponzi schemes through initial coin offerings (ICOs) ===
Most exit scams (or rugpulls) as well as many ponzi schemes involving cryptocurrencies are performed through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). As an example, according to a report by Satis Group, almost 80% of all projects launched through an ICO in 2017 were scams. These scams usually involve attracting investments from mostly retail investors, inflating the price and the perpetrators subsequently abandoning the project in question after selling off their own shares.
The novelty of ICOs accounts for the current lack of governmental regulation. This lack of regulatory measures as well as the pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions and their  international nature across countless jurisdictions in many different countries can make it much more difficult to identify and take legal action against perpetrators involved in these scams. Since 2017 the SEC has been actively pursuing groups and individuals responsible for ICO-related scams.


==== Examples of ICO-related scams ====
AriseCoin (AriseBank): AriseBank marketed itself as the world's first decentralized bank, falsely claiming to be able to offer FDIC-insured accounts, VISA cards as well as services related to cryptocurrency and making other false statements. AriseBank promoted its AriseCoin through celebrity endorsement and social media in order to raise the US$1 billion the company was aiming for. Their ICO was halted by the SEC in early 2018 with their CEO and COO receiving a fine of US$2.7 million.
BitConnect: Bitconnect was among the highest-performing cryptocurrencies in 2017, promising investors enormous returns through a trading bot. At its height, it reached a market capitalization of US$3.4 billion. In early 2018 the exchanged ceased to operate with investors losing millions of dollars, amounting to a total of US$14.5 million. It later turned out that the initial profits were generated through a Ponzi scheme by paying earlier customers with money made through newer customers. Legal action against the perpetrators was taken on an international scale.
Centra: Centra was a Miami-based company that claimed to offer a cryptocurrency-based debit card backed by a VISA and Mastercard. The company raised US$32 million by October 2017 through an ICO and, f few months later, performed an exit scam. In April 2018 two of the founders were arrested. It was soon revealed that neither Mastercard nor VISA backed the company in their alleged efforts.
Modern Tech (PinCoin/iFan): Based in Vietnam, Modern Tech hosted two separate ICOs for PinCoin as well as iFan promising monthly returns of 48%. After the initial success, the founders ran off with approximately US$660 million raised from 32,000 investors. The founders are still at large and none of the funds have been retrieved.
PlexCoin: After Dominic Lacroix and Sabrina Paradis-Rogers (the founders of PlexCoin) had officially raised around US$15 million through a fraudulent ICO in August 2017 while promising a return of 1,354 % within a month, the SEC filed a civil complaint in December of the same year against them and sought an injunction to cease those sales, freeze the assets involved, pay civil penalties and prohibit the ones responsible behind the token launch from participating in any future offerings of cryptocurrency. Shortly after Lacroix was sentenced to two months in prison and fined CA$110,000 by the Quebec Superior Court. The SEC's proceedings led to seven-figure fines for the defendants in 2019 and a retrieval of the investors' funds. During the proceedings, the SEC was able to prove that the success of the ICO was inflated by the founders who in fact had raised US$8.5 million instead of the US$15 million they had announced.


=== Ponzi schemes ===
Ponzi schemes are another common  form of utilizing blockchain-based technologies to commit fraud. Most schemes of this sort use multi-level marketing schemes to encourage investors to conduct risky investments. Onecoin is one of the more notable examples of cryptocurrency-ponzi schemes: Founded in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova, OneCoin is estimated to have generated US$4 billion in income. While at least in China some of the investors' funds have been recovered and several members of the organisation arrested in the U.S., Ignatova herself is still at large.


=== Money laundering ===

Due to the inability of third parties to de-pseudonymize crypto transactions criminal entities have often resorted to using cryptocurrency to conduct money laundering. Especially ICOs lacking KYC guidelines and anti-money laundering procedures are often used to launder illicit funds due to the pseudonymity they offer. By using ICOs criminals launder these funds by buying tokens off of legitimate investors and selling them. This issue is intensified by the lack of measures against money laundering implemented by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.
A well-known early example of money laundering using cryptocurrencies is Silk Road. Shut down in 2013 with its founder Ross Ulbricht indicted for among other counts a money laundering conspiracy, the website was used for several illicit activities including money laundering solely using Bitcoin as a form of payment.
Apart from traditional cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are also commonly used in connection with money laundering activities. NFTs are often used to perform Wash Trading by creating several different wallets for one individual, generating several fictitious sales and consequently selling the respective NFT to a third party. According to a report by Chainalysis, these types of wash trades are becoming increasingly popular among money launderers especially due to the largely anonymous nature of transactions on NFT marketplaces. Auction platforms for NFT sales may face regulatory pressure to comply with anti-money laundering legislation.


==== Regulatory measures ====
Canada is generally regarded as the first state actor implementing regulatory measures dealing with money laundering conducted by the usage of cryptocurrencies. By 2013 the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) — in direct reference to the centralized exchange Mt. Gox — issued regulations making it clear that all crypto-to-fiat exchangers had to apply KYC- as well as anti-money laundering methods. Any suspicious transactions have therefore to be reported to the authorities. Centralized exchanges have to register as money transmitters, with the exact definition of who and what constitutes a money transmitter in the crypto sphere being somewhat blurred and regulations differing between the different states of the U.S. An important exemption from these regulations is decentralized exchanges due to the fact that they do not hold any fiat currency.
As part of the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive of 2018 and in an effort to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the European Union has issued a directive making all member-states have to make sure that crypto exchanges are licensed and registered. The EU is furthermore planning to take measures to ensure that all customers of cryptocurrency exchanges are to verify their identity as part of the registration process.


===== Regarding NFTs =====
Auction platforms for NFT sales may face regulatory pressure to comply with anti-money laundering legislation. A February 2022 study from the United States Treasury assessed that there was ""some evidence of money laundering risk in the high-value art market,"" including through ""the emerging digital art market, such as the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)."" The study considered how NFT transactions may be a simpler option for laundering money through art by avoiding transportation or insurance complications in trading physical art. Several NFT exchanges were labeled as virtual asset service providers that may be subject to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network regulations.
The European Union has yet to establish specific regulations to combat money laundering through NFTs. The European Commission announced in July 2022 that it is planning to draw regulations regarding that issue by 2024.

=== Further examples ===
Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of US$9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold ""investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated"" from mining. Garza was later found guilty of fraud and ordered to pay US$9 million and begin serving a 21-month sentence commencing January 2019 by the U.S. Attorney's Office District of Connecticut.
The cryptocurrency community refers to pre-mining, hidden launches, ICO or extreme rewards for the altcoin founders as deceptive practices. This is at times an inherent part of the cryptocurrency's design. Pre-mining refers to the practice of generating the currency before its released to the public.
FTX and Alameda Research founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was indicted by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2022 and charged with commodities and wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, as well as with violating campaign finance laws.
In 2025, U.S. authorities led by the Department of Justice and the FBI’s San Diego Field Office have seized approximately $2.5 million in cryptocurrency linked to a series of sophisticated fraud schemes. The forfeiture, approved by U.S. District Court, targets criminals who exploited digital financial platforms to defraud victims, often through so-called ""confidence schemes."" The crackdown involved collaboration with various agencies and support from Tether, a crypto industry company, and aims to both compensate victims and deter future online fraud.


== Malware ==


=== Malware attacks ===
Some malware can steal private keys for bitcoin wallets allowing the bitcoins themselves to be stolen. The most common type searches computers for cryptocurrency wallets to upload to a remote server where they can be cracked and their coins are stolen. Many of these also log keystrokes to record passwords, often avoiding the need to crack the keys. A different approach detects when a bitcoin address is copied to a clipboard and quickly replaces it with a different address, tricking people into sending bitcoins to the wrong address. This method is effective because bitcoin transactions are irreversible.: 57 
One virus, spread through the Pony botnet, was reported in February 2014 to have stolen up to $220,000 in cryptocurrencies including bitcoins from 85 wallets. Security company Trustwave, which tracked the malware, reports that its latest version was able to steal 30 types of digital currency.
A type of Mac malware active in August 2013, Bitvanity posed as a vanity wallet address generator and stole addresses and private keys from other bitcoin client software. A different trojan for macOS, called CoinThief was reported in February 2014 to be responsible for multiple bitcoin thefts. The software was hidden in versions of some cryptocurrency apps on Download.com and MacUpdate.


=== Ransomware ===
Many types of ransomware demand payment in bitcoin. One program called CryptoLocker, typically spread through legitimate-looking email attachments, encrypts the hard drive of an infected computer, then displays a countdown timer and demands a ransom in bitcoin, to decrypt it. Massachusetts police said they paid a 2 bitcoin ransom in November 2013, worth more than $1,300 at the time, to decrypt one of their hard drives. Bitcoin was used as the ransom medium in the WannaCry ransomware.
One ransomware variant disables internet access and demands credit card information to restore it, while secretly mining bitcoins.
As of June 2018, most ransomware attackers preferred to use currencies other than bitcoin, with 44% of attacks in the first half of 2018 demanding Monero, which is highly private and difficult to trace, compared to 10% for bitcoin and 11% for Ether.


=== Unauthorized mining ===


== Phishing ==
A phishing website to generate private IOTA wallet seed passphrases, and collected wallet keys, with estimates of up to US$4 million worth of MIOTA tokens stolen. The malicious website operated for an unknown amount of time and was discovered in January 2018.


== Fraud factories ==
Fraud factories in Asia traffic workers to scam Westerners into buying cryptocurrencies online.


== Other incidents ==
In 2015, two members of the Silk Road Task Force—a multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of Silk Road—were convicted over charges pertaining to corruption. Former DEA agent, Carl Mark Force, had attempted to extort Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht (""Dread Pirate Roberts"") by faking the murder of an informant. He pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice, and extortion under color of official right, and was sentenced to 6.5 years in federal prison. Former U.S. Secret Service agent, Shaun Bridges, pleaded guilty to crimes relating to his diversion of $800,000 worth of bitcoins to his personal account during the investigation, and also separately pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection to another cryptocurrency theft. Bridges was sentenced to almost eight years in federal prison.
Gerald Cotten founded QuadrigaCX in 2013, after graduating from the Schulich School of Business in Toronto. Cotten was acting as the sole curator of the exchange. Quadriga had no official bank accounts since banks at the time had no method of managing cryptocurrency. In late 2018, Canada's largest crypto exchange QuadrigaCX lost US$190 million in cryptocurrency when the owner died; he was the only one with knowledge of the password to a storage wallet. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2019.
In 2018, Ellis Pinsky, 15 years old, was accused of orchestrating a scheme to steal millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from Michael Terpin, a prominent cryptocurrency investor. The scheme involved a social engineering technique known as the SIM swap scam. The case attracted significant attention due to Pinsky's young age and the substantial amount of money involved. It raised questions about the security of digital assets and the challenges in regulating and prosecuting crimes in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Pinsky later reached a settlement to return $22 million in cryptocurrency to Terpin. In May 2020, Pinsky experienced a home invasion by intruders searching for remaining stolen assets. 
Michael Terpin, the founder and chief executive officer of Transform Group, a San Juan, Puerto Rico-based company that advises blockchain businesses on public relations and communications, sued Ellis Pinsky in New York on May 7, 2020, for leading a ""sophisticated cybercrime spree"" that stole US$24 million in cryptocurrency by hacking into Terpin's phone in 2018. Terpin also sued Nicholas Truglia and won a $75.8 million judgment against Truglia in 2019 in California state court.
On July 15, 2020, Twitter accounts of prominent personalities and firms, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Apple, Kanye West, Michael Bloomberg and Uber were hacked. Twitter confirmed that it was a coordinated social engineering attack on their own employees. Twitter released its statement six hours after the attack took place. Hackers posted the message to transfer the Bitcoin to a Bitcoin wallet, which would double the amount. The wallet's balance was expected to increase to more than $100,000 as the message spread among Twitter followers.
In 2021, US Authorities carried out a raid on James Zhong's home in Gainesville, Georgia. Authorities found over 51,000 bitcoin that Zhong had stolen from Silk Road between 2012 and 2013. Through an error on Silk Road, Zhong was able to withdraw more bitcoin than what was initially deposited. He concealed his identity and was able to evade authorities for nearly a decade. Zhong ended up pleading guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in prison along with a forfeiture of all bitcoin.
In 2022, the Federal Trade Commission reported that $139 million in cryptocurrency was stolen by romance scammers in 2020. Some scammers target dating apps with fake profiles.
In early 2022, the Beanstalk cryptocurrency was stripped of its reserves, which were valued at more than US$180 million, after attackers had managed to use borrowed US$80 million in cryptocurrency to buy enough voting rights to transfer the reserves to their own accounts outside the system. It was initially unclear if such an exploit of governance procedures was illegal.
In 2025, A Nigerian scammer impersonated Trump ally Steve Witkoff by creating a nearly identical email address to solicit a $250,000 cryptocurrency donation from a political donor intended for the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The donor, deceived by the subtle change in the email domain, transferred 250,300 USDT.ETH, which was quickly laundered through multiple wallets. The FBI, with help from Tether and Binance, managed to recover and freeze about $40,300 of the stolen funds, but over $210,000 remains missing. Officials warn that the complexity of blockchain transactions makes recovering stolen crypto extremely difficult.

Zandt, Florian (31 March 2022). ""Infographic: The Biggest Crypto Heists"". Statista."
"The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is a non-ministerial government department of the Government of the United Kingdom that investigates and prosecutes serious or complex fraud and corruption in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The SFO is accountable to the Attorney General for England and Wales, and was established by the Criminal Justice Act 1987, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 grants the SFO powers to require any person (or business/bank) to provide any relevant documents (including confidential ones) and answer any relevant questions including ones about confidential matters. The SFO is the principal enforcer of the Bribery Act 2010, which has been designed to encourage good corporate governance and enhance the reputation of the City of London and the UK as a safe place to do business. Its jurisdiction does not extend to Scotland, where fraud and corruption are investigated by Police Scotland through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.


== History ==


=== Formation of the unit ===

During the 1970s and early 1980s a series of financial scandals in the City of London destroyed the public's trust in the way serious or complex frauds were handled. In response to this the Government established the Fraud Trials Committee in 1983. This independent committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Roskill, considered how changes to the law and criminal proceedings could lead to more effective ways of fighting fraud. The committee report, commonly known as the Roskill Report was published in 1986. Its main recommendation was to set up a new, unified organisation responsible for detecting, investigating and prosecuting serious fraud cases. As a result, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and its unique powers were created by the Criminal Justice Act 1987, ""an Act to make further provision for the investigation of and trials for fraud; and for connected purposes"". It opened for business in April 1988. The SFO also enforces the Bribery Act 2010.


=== List of directors ===
John Wood CB (1988–1990)
Dame Barbara Mills QC (1990–1992)
George Staple CB QC (1992–1997)
Rosalind Wright CB QC (1997–2003)
Robert Wardle (2003–2008)
Richard Alderman (2008–2012)
Sir David Green CB QC (2012–2018)
Lisa Osofsky (2018–2023)
Nick Ephgrave QPM (2023–present)


=== Al-Yamamah investigation ===
The Al-Yamamah arms deal during the 1980s was a large scale aircraft and weapons deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia. It was extended throughout the 1990s and saw thousands of British citizens living and working in Saudi Arabia representing £40 billion worth of business. BAE Systems Plc was the primary contractor. In 2004 the SFO began to investigate the contracts within the al-Yamamah deal on the grounds of suspected false accounting, but the investigation was controversially dropped in 2006. The decision was made following concerns about national security amidst reports that the Saudi Government would stop sharing counterterrorist information with the UK if the investigation continued. This drew criticism from number of sources, not least from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). A High Court review in 2008 ruled that the SFO had acted unlawfully by dropping the corruption investigation but this was later overturned on appeal by the SFO to the House of Lords.


=== Comparison to New York ===
In 2008, an official internal ""Review of the Serious Fraud Office"", which was conducted by a former senior New York City prosecutor, compared the SFO unfavourably with two of its counterparts in New York City: the offices of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the New York County District Attorney. It found that the American prosecutors obtained higher conviction rates in a shorter amount of time with fewer resources. It also found that the SFO had significantly lower conviction rates than elite divisions of the British Crown Prosecution Service. It attributed the SFO's relatively poor performance to, among other things, failure to keep all court advocacy ""in-house"", failure to assign each case a single lawyer who managed it ""from cradle to grave"", failure to interview witnesses at an early stage, and failure to co-operate closely with the police.


=== 2010s ===
While Home Secretary, Theresa May expressed that she wanted the National Crime Agency (NCA) to absorb the SFO. While the SFO is supervised by the Attorney General's Office, the NCA is overseen by the Home Office. From around 2005 to 2017, the SFO underwent a series of budget cuts.
On 18 May 2017, the Tories released a manifesto pledging to dismantle the Serious Fraud Office and roll it into the NCA if they won the general elections in June 2017. The manifesto claimed that the incorporation would ""strengthen Britain's response to white collar crime by... improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime.""


== Notable cases ==


=== Guinness share-trading fraud ===

In 1986 there were rumours that the Guinness Brewery takeover of the Distillers Company was tainted by an unlawful share support operation which involved Guinness offering secret indemnities (from its own funds) against losses to people 'supporting' the bid which resulted in a dramatic rise in the price of Guinness shares.
Having examined the bid, the SFO opened an investigation which led to the conviction in 1990 of the then chief executive of Guinness and three other defendants.


=== BAE Systems weapons sales to Saudi Arabia ===

Al Yamamah is the name of a series of a record arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. In 2006, an investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office into the deal was discontinued after political pressure from the Saudi and British governments.


=== BAE Systems radar sale to Tanzania ===

In 1999 British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd agreed a contract with the Government of Tanzania for the supply of a radar defence system. A local businessman in Tanzania was recruited to advise BAE on its negotiations with the Government on the radar contract.
Between January 2000 and December 2005 around $12.4 million was paid to the local businessman's two companies. BAE has accepted that there was a high probability that part of this sum would be used to favour it in the contract negotiations with the Tanzanian Government.
The payments were not subject to proper and adequate scrutiny or review and BAE Systems Plc was subsequently fined £500,000 after admitting that it had failed to keep adequate accounting records of the defence contract with the Government of Tanzania. This outcome followed a settlement by BAE, as part of a global agreement reached in 2010 with the Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice, concerning contracts in a number of countries. The settlement with the SFO relates to the Tanzanian contract.  The terms of the settlement include an agreement by BAE to pay an ex-gratia sum (£30 million less any fine imposed by the Crown Court) for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. BAE was also ordered to pay £225,000 costs to the SFO.


=== Barclays emergency fundraising ===
In June 2017, John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath were charged with offences regarding Barclays's raising of £11.8 billion in emergency funds. The fraud was alleged to have taken place around the 2008 financial crisis.


=== Abbas Gokal & the BCCI ===

The BCCI Bank was a Luxembourg-registered bank that collapsed in 1992. It was discovered by the bank's auditors, that the bank was running on loss for many years. It was reported that the bank was involved in drug-trafficking, money-laundering and phony loans. The key player in the collapse was Pakistani shipping magnate Abbas Gokal. It was discovered that Gokal's company, Gulf Shipping Lines, had received a US$1.2 billion unsecured loan from the bank. When the bank collapsed and the scandal emerged, Gokal escaped to Pakistan, but since the United Kingdom and Pakistan had no extradition treaty, he could not be extradited to the UK to stand trial.
However, when Gokal was making a trip to America in 1994, his plane stopped for re-fueling in Frankfurt. There, German police arrested him and extradited him to the United Kingdom. He was handed a 14-year sentence as a result of the SFO prosecution, the longest sentence handed out in a British court for fraud.


=== Mykola Zlochevsky ===
In April 2014, the SFO launched a money laundering investigation against Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. Accounts of Burisma Holdings and its parent Brociti Investments, controlled by Zlochevsky, were frozen at the London branch of BNP Paribas. That money US$23 million was transferred as a result of complex transactions by a company controlled by a Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Kurchenko, a subject of the European Union restrictive measures. When the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office failed to provide documents needed for the investigation, a British court in January 2015 dropped the case and ordered the assets be unfrozen.


== Organisation ==
As one of the Law Officers' Departments, the SFO reports to the Attorney General for England and Wales. The SFO is unique in that its role is to both investigate and prosecute. Its case teams are therefore made up of investigators, lawyers, law clerks and forensic accountants. The SFO employs around 500 people. The cost of running the SFO in the financial year 2010–11 was 64p for each member of the British public. Over 80 per cent of staff are specialist caseworkers.  When deciding what action to take, lawyers in the SFO must bear in mind the Prosecutors Code.
The SFO is not a police force and its own investigators are not constables.  Although the SFO does have certain investigatory powers, it does not have the powers of arrest or police powers in relation to search.  Therefore, if these powers are necessary for an investigation the SFO will request support from the police or NCA as necessary.


== Activities and responsibilities ==
The SFO is a specialist organisation that investigates only the most serious types of economic crime.  As a result, a potential case must meet certain criteria before it is taken on.  In deciding, the Director will take into account all the circumstances of the case and consider:

cases which undermine British commercial/financial PLC in general and the City of London in particular;
cases where the actual or potential loss involved are high;
cases where actual or potential harm is significant;
cases where there is a very significant public interest element; and
new species of fraud
The Serious Fraud Office's jurisdiction does not extend to Scotland where fraud and corruption are investigated by Police Scotland through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.


=== Fraud ===
The SFO investigates and prosecutes fraud. The SFO prosecutes different types of fraud, including investment fraud. Among the types of investment fraud prosecuted are boiler room fraud (share scams), which is an operation, usually run from abroad, where scammers typically cold-call people and use hard-sell tactics to sell shares that prove worthless, are inflated in price, or don't exist. The SFO cites Vintage Wines of St Albans as an example of a successful boiler room fraud prosecution. The SFO also prosecutes the investment schemes called 'Ponzi' or pyramid schemes, which typically involves an investment offer which promises to provide an abnormally higher rate of return. In a Ponzi scheme, a single operator benefits, while in a pyramid scheme, many investors benefit from recruiting other investors. The SFO has cited the KF Concept case as an example of one of its successful ponzi scheme prosecutions, where a banker was jailed for 10 years for running an unauthorized investment business and defrauding investors of amounts over £17 million.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK has received an additional £9.3 million from the government to enhance its capabilities in addressing complex fraud and corruption. This funding aims to improve the agency's resources and operational efficiency, particularly in light of concerns regarding its effectiveness in handling high-profile cases that have resulted in failed prosecutions.
Critics have raised issues about delays and inefficiencies in the SFO's investigations, which can impede successful outcomes. The increase in funding is intended to help the SFO respond more effectively to serious Financial crimes. There are ongoing discussions about the need for more substantial long-term support to ensure that the SFO can adequately fulfill its mandate and tackle the rising threats posed by financial crime and corruption in the UK.
The SFO also prosecutes multiple types of corporate fraud. The SFO website as of 2013 outlined several types of fraud it classified as corporate, including asset stripping, which involved company directors taking company funds or assets of value while leaving behind the debts. Other types of prosecuted corporate fraud include fraudulent trading, where a company carries on a business for any fraudulent purposes. An example of a successful SFO prosecution for fraudulent trading is the InterGB group, the collective name for a number of companies that, between 1996 and 2000, extracted more than £85 million from three financial institutions by submitting false invoices. The chairman of the group was jailed for seven years. Also prosecuted is 'share ramping', also known as 'pump and dump' or 'book ramping', is where criminals influence the share price of a company and then take advantage of the price fluctuations. Publishing false information is also prosecuted as corporate crime. According to the SFO, this is usually done to mislead investors and creditors and to keep a failing company trading.


=== Bribery and corruption ===
According to the SFO, corruption is where the integrity of a person, Government, or company is manipulated and compromised for personal gain. SFO classifies and prosecutes two main types of corruption. It defines political corruption as the dysfunction of a political system or institution in which government officials, political officials or employees look for illegitimate personal gain through actions such as bribery, extortion, cronyism, patronage and embezzlement. It defines corporate corruption as where, for example, bribes are offered to agencies, institutions or individuals in order to win a contract. It brought up Innospec Limited, manufacturers of a fuel additive, as an example of a successful prosecution for corporate corruption.


=== Self-reporting ===
The SFO encourages self-reporting of fraud. Azizur Rahman, senior partner at law firm Rahman Ravelli has provided further guidance on internal investigations of alleged bribery and the potential leniency benefits of self-reporting, although he notes that the SFO will still investigate: they will not simply take a company's self-report ""at face value"".


=== Overseas assistance ===
The SFO has a dedicated International Assistance team which regularly assists law enforcement agencies worldwide with their investigations. In 2010–11 the SFO assisted over 30 different jurisdictions.


=== Victim support ===
According to the SFO, victims are at the core of its strategy. They include any person, organisation, or Government both in the UK and abroad, which has suffered direct financial loss from the most serious and complex fraud, or corruption.
The SFO tries to get justice for victims by recovering as much recompense as possible for victims. In April 2011, £64 million of funds were, or were due to be returned to victims. The average jail sentence handed out in SFO cases was 56 months in 2010-11. For example, in 2011 three fraudsters running the online Xclusive ticket fraud (that failed to deliver tickets to the Beijing Olympics and various music festivals) each received prison sentences of up to eight years. The SFO started confiscation proceedings to recover money for victims.


== Recent Investigations ==
The SFO launched an investigation into the collapsed law firm Axiom Ince in 2023. This case involved allegations of £66 million in missing client money and resulted in significant action by the SFO. In January 2023, the agency conducted searches at three premises across England, leading to three arrests. The SFO continues to actively pursue assets from convicted fraudsters. In October 2024, the agency successfully recovered £295,000 from Virendra Rastogi's hidden pension funds. This recovery was part of an ongoing proceeds of crime investigation that has yielded nearly £6 million to date, including the sale of Rastogi's Marylebone home and seizure of valuable assets. In November 2024, the SFO received an additional £9.3 million in funding from the government. This investment aims to strengthen the agency's capacity to recover criminal assets, expand its use of technology for disclosure purposes, and improve its case management system. The SFO's work frequently involves cross-border investigations, highlighting the international nature of many financial crimes. The agency maintains cooperation with international partners, as evidenced by its collaboration with the Australian Federal Police in the Rio Tinto case. 
In December 2024, five former members of national firm Axiom Ince have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office with offences including fraud, forgery and the destruction of documents relating to the collapse of the firm and the alleged misuse of client money.


== Ongoing Challenges ==
Despite these developments, the SFO continues to face challenges in handling high-profile cases. The agency has experienced setbacks, including the collapse of some prosecutions, which has led to scrutiny of its effectiveness in complex financial crime cases. These recent activities and developments demonstrate the SFO's continued efforts to adapt and strengthen its capabilities in the fight against serious fraud and financial crime. 


== Criticism ==
The SFO, which reports to the Attorney General's Office, has over time repeatedly faced attempts by politicians to roll it into a broader crime-fighting body. In December 2021 the Court of Appeal criticised the SFO with regards to their handling of the Unaoil case for ‘wholly inappropriate’ contacts with a ‘fixer’, for which the agency had already been criticised, as well as ""serious"" disclosure failures undermining a defendant's right to a fair trial. Three court of appeal judges overturned the conviction of a businessman because of the watchdog's misconduct. In July 2020, His Honour Judge Beddoe had rebuked SFO director Lisa Osofsky over ""flattering"" texts from a US-based private investigator who was seeking to secure more favourable sentences for his clients. The judge criticised Osofsky for making herself ""vulnerable to ""flattery"" following inappropriate contact with private investigator David Tinsley and said the SFO's contact with him should be ""comprehensively reviewed to see what lessons can be learned from it"".
The decision came months after the trial of two Serco executives charged with fraud collapsed because of SFO disclosure errors. In a written statement after his acquittal, Mr Marshall said. ""It is clear to me that I was prosecuted, not as a result of a fair assessment of the evidence, but because I was collateral damage in the deal that was done by Serco with the SFO."" Judge said the SFO took the view that issues identified had ""undermined the process of disclosure in this case to the extent that the trial cannot safely and fairly proceed"".
The cases raised serious questions about the SFO's approach. The Justice Committee launched a new inquiry to investigate the criminal justice system's approach to combatting fraud. The Committee examined the approach of the Serious Fraud Office to combatting economic crime and responding to the challenges of Brexit and the pandemic. It also examined what lessons have been learnt from recent high-profile cases, as well as addressing concerns over evidence disclosure, staff culture and victim support (in March and October 2022).
The office of the attorney general issued a statement saying Suella Braverman was ""deeply concerned about the findings in the judgment"". The attorney general then launched a ""forensic and robust"" probe in to the failings at the Britain's main anti-corruption agency. The Attorney General, Suella Braverman stated: ""I announced this review on the day of the judgment as it was clear to me that swift action was needed. We must ensure lessons are learned so that the failings we saw in the Unaoil case can never happen again.""
In February 2022, the SFO became subject to an inquiry by the UK Public Accounts Committee, which monitors state spending, as the collapse of the so-called ""Serco case"" caused serious financial harm to the SFO budget. SFO director Lisa Osofsky appeared before the committee to explain a £2.55m overspend in 2020/21, which was the result of the failed prosecution of two former directors of Serco.
This led to public debate about possible future of SFO and its leadership. In June 2022 it was announced that the ""forensic and robust review"" commissioned by the Attorney General which was conducted by Sir David Calvert-Smith was delayed. On 21 July 2022 the review was published. Osofsky commented on the report as a: ""sobering read"". The review was criticizing the conduct of SFO head: ""It is clear that Osofsky was faced with a difficult situation very early in her tenure and made a number of mistakes and misjudgments which, with the benefit of hindsight, she now accepts."" Calvert-Smith said further that Osofsky ""was not supposed to be personally involved in contact"" with a fixer, who had no recognised legal role in the so-called Unaoil case.
Calvert-Smith's review paints a picture of chaotic management of the Unaoil case and a ""toxic"" relationship between staff and senior management within the SFO. A ""damaging culture of distrust"" between the case team and senior managers developed, the review said. The review found some failings in the case involved ""cultural issues within the SFO"", such as noncompliant record keeping, ""failure to comply with its disclosure obligations"", ""inadequate resourcing of the case"", ""DSFO using her personal mobile phone and failing to take contemporaneous notes of meetings and conversations"" and a ""lack of understanding of priorities between the case team and senior management"", amplified by the impression that a U.S. fixer had the ""seal of approval"" from the director and, caused in part by the suspension and unfair and wrongful dismissal of the Unaoil case controller, Tom Martin was suspended in July 2018. In February 2021, the judge concluded that Tom Martin's complaints of unfair dismissal and breach of contract were ""well founded"". In July 2022, SFO lost its appeal over unfair sacking of Martin.
Emily Thornberry MP, Labour's Shadow Attorney General, stated on the report that it ""lays bare a catalogue of woeful mismanagement and inexplicable misjudgements at the top of the SFO"". In direct reference to Osofsky Thornberry said the SFO's leadership had shown ""gullibility and arrogance"" in their dealings with a ""fixer"", she tweeted on 21 July. She stated further ""It is vital that the Attorney General not only commits to implement Sir David's recommendations in full, but asks herself whether the senior managers at the SFO whose failures are exposed in this report are really the individuals best placed to repair the damage. Earlier this year Thornberry tweeted: ""The Unaoil debacle is not a one-off.""
Brian Altman KC was commissioned by the SFO to review the Serco case. He noted there had been ""systemic problems of real concern"" in relation to the SFO's disclosure in that case, including that the appointed officer's ""inexperience should have disqualified him from appointment as disclosure officer on such a large and complex case"". The Serious Fraud Office has not referred any lawyers to the Solicitors Regulation Authority over the collapse of a high-profile criminal trial, MPs heard in February 2022. The SFO must prevent third parties having ""direct access"" to the watchdog's director and ensure all prosecutions have an ""effective disclosure strategy"", Calvert-Smith's review into the calamitous Unaoil bribery case recommended – as a third man jailed after the investigation had his name cleared. These stinging defeats for the SFO have ""left the entire Unaoil case on shaky ground"".
According to the Spotlight on corruption, Serco and Unaoil ""botched disclosures raise concerns about whether there are more systemic problems in the SFO’s strategy and conduct of high-stakes cases."" The blame for three quashed convictions in the Unaoil bribery case and the midtrial collapse of another case against two Serco executives is both institutional and individual. Both cases were sunk by the SFO's failure to properly disclose evidence to the defense. The reports found the SFO struggled to keep adequate records, failed to properly oversee case progression and failed to carry out disclosure checks, and that its key staff were too inexperienced to handle the process. Both Brian Altman's KC review into the collapse of the R v Woods and Marshall trial and Sir David Calvert-Smith's review into the SFO's handling of the Unaoil investigation exposed the scale of the agency's problems and challenges. Susan Hawley, executive director at anti-corruption charity Spotlight on Corruption, said: ""Both the Calvert-Smith and the Altman reviews point to similar and very serious underlying issues behind the SFO’s spate of collapsed trials.""
The UK's Serious Fraud Office spent £16.2 million on its corruption investigation into the oil consultancy Unaoil, with nearly a third allocated to external legal fees. The investigation faced significant challenges, including the quashing of three bribery convictions due to non-disclosure of evidence and the collapse of a fourth trial. 


=== Conflicts between SFO and private interests ===
In August 2022, Lisa Osofsky stated that she was proud of a ""revolving door"" between the regulator and private firms as fears grew that movement of senior figures into private sector would transfer inside knowledge into companies, which were subject to investigations. Among the individuals criticized for moving from senior positions in the SFO to private law firms were Sir David Green, the SFO's former director, two of its former general counsels, four former heads or co-heads of its bribery and corruption divisions, two former heads of its fraud division and the former heads of its assurance and international assistance divisions.
In November 2021, in her letter: ""SFO’s revolving door works better than a closed shop"" published by the Financial Times Osofsky said that they ""advocate for the interchange of personnel. It has always happened and long may it continue. It grows the collective capability of our organisation more than a closed shop ever could."" She noted that they already use one, ""much to our advantage. In short, we advocate for the interchange of personnel,"" and that ""our relatively modest budget doesn’t prevent us from delivering"".
In March 2023, Private Eye magazine, a UK-based widely recognized news and current affairs publication edited by Ian Hislop, revealed that SFO chief Lisa Osofsky has been forced to disclose further information about her recusal from three separate investigations. Private Eye wrote that the SFO's 2021 annual report revealed that Lisa Osofsky recused herself from three investigations; Barclays bank, Harlequin properties, and a third unnamed investigation. Media noted that none of Osofsky's predecessors had ever needed to recuse themselves from live investigations. After Private Eye sent a Freedom of Information request about the nature of the recusals and advice given to Osofsky, the SFO said that it would not disclose details about what Osofsky's links were to the investigations. Media highlighted the clear conflict of interest in Osofsky's decision to reject disclosure under the FOI request, and commented that the whole affair remains ""unexplained and unsatisfactory"".

"The Serious Fraud Office (SFO; Māori: Te Tari Hara Tāware) is the public service department of New Zealand charged with detecting, investigating and prosecuting financial crimes, including corruption, of a serious and complex nature.
The SFO is New Zealand's lead law enforcement agency for investigating and prosecuting serious financial crime, including bribery and corruption. The Auckland-based agency has about 50 employees of which 90 percent perform front-line activities. It has statutory independence as operational decisions are made without ministerial direction. The agency is based upon its UK counterpart as established by the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990. The SFO was established as a response to the collapse of the capital markets following the stock market crash in 1987.


== Investigation procedures ==
Suspects questioned by the SFO have no right to silence and must answer questions and produce requested evidence, even if it incriminates them. However, evidence at an interview cannot be used against a suspect at his or her trial, unless he or she gives evidence which contradicts their SFO interview. Witnesses can also be required to answer questions under compulsion. Such interviews enable people with confidentiality agreements with clients to speak freely to the SFO without fear of retribution from their clients. These provisions do not override legal professional privilege. Anyone who refuses to comply can be prosecuted and could be fined or jailed.  Prosecutions are extremely rare and no one has been jailed for this offence.


== History ==
When set up under the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990, the responsible minister was the Attorney-General.
The Labour government announced in September 2007 that the SFO would be replaced by a new Organised Crime Agency. However, the bill to disband the SFO was delayed by the 2008 general election, and the new prime minister John Key informed Parliament that the SFO would not be disbanded.
In 2008, ministerial responsibility was transferred from the Attorney-General to the Minister of Police, to avoid a potential conflict of interest in the Attorney-General's roles.


== SFO directors ==
Since it was established in 1990, the Serious Fraud Office has had six directors. The following is a complete list:


== SFO cases ==
Equiticorp – Founding director Allan Hawkins   sentenced to six years' imprisonment in 1992
Fortex – CEO Graeme Thompson and CFO Michael Mullen sentenced to imprisonment in 1994
ACC – Former Auditor-General and ACC boss, Jeff Chapman, convicted of fraudulently using documents in 1997
Otago DHB – CIO  Michael Swann convicted of defrauding the DHB of nearly $17m and sentenced to nine years, six months' imprisonment in 2009
Ross Asset Management – David Ross sentenced to 10 years, 10 months' imprisonment in 2013
South Canterbury Finance – Director and lawyer Edward Sullivan sentenced to home detention and community work in 2014
Kang Huang and Others – Kang Huang sentenced to four years, seven months' imprisonment in 2018 for his part in a $54 million mortgage fraud
Bryan Bruce's 1995 documentary, Serious Fraud, examined the SFO's investigations into white collar crime within New Zealand, and focused on three cases: Allan Hawkins, Roger Curtis and Patrick Renshaw.

"Frank William Abagnale Jr. (; born April 27, 1948) is an American security consultant, author, and convicted felon who committed frauds that mainly targeted individuals and small businesses. He later gained notoriety in the late 1970s by claiming a diverse range of workplace frauds, many of which have since been placed in doubt. In 1980, Abagnale co-wrote his autobiography, Catch Me If You Can, which built a narrative around these claimed frauds. The book inspired the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002, in which Abagnale was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has also written four other books. Abagnale runs Abagnale and Associates, a consulting firm.
Abagnale claims to have worked as an assistant state attorney general in the U.S. state of Louisiana, served as a hospital physician in Georgia, and impersonated a Pan American World Airways pilot who logged over two million air miles by deadheading. The veracity of most of Abagnale's claims has been questioned, and ongoing inquiries continue to confirm that they were fabricated. In 2002, Abagnale admitted on his website that some facts had been overdramatized or exaggerated, though he was not specific about what was exaggerated or omitted about his life. In 2020, journalist Alan C. Logan claimed to have found evidence he claims proves the majority of Abagnale's story was invented or at best exaggerated.


== Early life ==
Frank William Abagnale Jr. was born in the Bronx, New York City, on April 27, 1948, to an Algerian-American mother who died in November 2014, and an Italian-American father who died in March 1972. He spent his early life in Bronxville, New York. His parents separated when he was 12 and divorced when he was 15 years old. After the divorce, Abagnale moved with his father, and his new stepmother, to Mount Vernon, New York.
Abagnale claims his first victim was his father, who gave him a gasoline credit card and a truck, and was ultimately liable for a bill amounting to $3,400. Abagnale was only 15 at the time. In his autobiography, Abagnale says, because of this crime, he was sent to a reform school in Westchester County, New York (fitting the description of the Lincolndale Agricultural School) run by Catholic Charities USA. In numerous interviews, Abagnale has claimed he attended an elite Catholic private school in Westchester, New York, Iona Preparatory School, through the 10th grade at age 16 in 1964. Abagnale is not mentioned by name, though, nor do any photographs of him appear in the Iona Preparatory School yearbooks from the time he ostensibly attended. Moreover, no alumni recall Abagnale ever attending the high school.
In December 1964, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 16. He was discharged after less than three months, and was released on February 18, 1965. Less than two weeks after his release, Abagnale was arrested for petty larceny in Mount Vernon on February 26, 1965. The following month, in March 1965, Abagnale identified himself as a Scarsdale, New York, police officer and entered the apartment of a Mount Vernon, New York, resident claiming that he was investigating her teenaged daughter. Suspicious, the victim called the Mount Vernon police, who found Abagnale with a toy gun and a paper police badge. Abagnale was arrested and booked on a vagrancy charge after being identified in a lineup by the victim. The following day, Abagnale was ordered by the court to be committed to Grasslands psychiatric institute, in Westchester County, for observation.
In June 1965, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Abagnale in Eureka, California, for car theft after he stole a Ford Mustang from one of his father's neighbors. Abagnale was pictured in the local newspaper, seated in a car, being questioned by Special Agent Richard Miller of the FBI. He had financed his cross-country trip from New York to California with blank checks stolen from a family business located on the Bronx River Parkway. Abagnale was also charged with impersonating a US customs official, although this charge was subsequently dropped. On July 2, 1965, this stolen-car case was transferred to the Southern District of New York.


=== Airline pilot ===
After being released into the custody of his father to face the stolen-car charges, 17-year-old Abagnale decided to impersonate a pilot. He obtained a uniform at a Manhattan uniform company, purchased with the money he obtained from the forgery of checks and on July 7, 1965, informed local media that he was a graduate of the American Airlines pilot school in Fort Worth, Texas, but he was arrested for theft of checks in Tuckahoe, New York days later. Abagnale was sentenced to three years at the Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York for these stolen checks. After serving only two years of his sentence, he was released into the custody of his mother, but he broke the terms of his parole with a stolen-car conviction in Boston, Massachusetts, and was returned to Great Meadow for one year.
After his release on December 24, 1968, 20-year-old Abagnale disguised himself as a TWA pilot and moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he talked his way into the house of a local music teacher, whose daughter was a Delta Air Lines stewardess he had met in New York. In Baton Rouge, Abagnale also befriended a local minister, claimed he had a master's degree in social work from Ithaca College, and sought work with vulnerable youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The reverend introduced him to Louisiana State University faculty, who determined he was an ""obvious phony"". The reverend, after Abagnale told him he was a furloughed TWA pilot, became suspicious and called the airline, which informed him that Abagnale was a fraud. The reverend notified the Baton Rouge Police Department, and Abagnale was arrested on February 14, 1969, initially on vagrancy charges. Upon his arrest, he was found to have illegally driven his Florida rental car out of state and to possess falsified airline employee identification. The following day, detectives determined that Abagnale had stolen blank checks from his host family and a local business in Baton Rouge, and he was subsequently charged with theft and forgery. Unable to make bail, he was convicted on June 2, 1969, and was sentenced to 12 years of supervised probation, but he soon fled Louisiana for Europe.


== Europe ==
Two weeks after the Louisiana bench warrant was issued, Abagnale was arrested in Montpellier, France, in September 1969. He had stolen an automobile and defrauded two local families in Klippan, Sweden. He was sentenced to four months for theft in France, though he served only three months in Perpignan's prison.
He was then extradited to Sweden, where he was convicted of gross fraud by forgery. He served two months in a Malmö prison, was banned from Sweden for eight years, and was required to compensate his Swedish victims (which he allegedly failed to do). Abagnale was deported back to the United States in June 1970, when his appeal failed.


== United States ==
After returning to the United States, 22-year-old Abagnale dressed in a pilot's uniform and traveled around college campuses, passing bad checks and claiming he was there to recruit stewardesses for Pan Am. At the University of Arizona, he stated that he was a pilot and a doctor. According to Paul Holsen, a student at the time, Abagnale conducted physical examinations on several female college students who wanted to be part of flight crews. None of the women was ever enrolled in Abagnale's fictional program, as his autobiography and film depict.
After Abagnale cashed a personal check made to look like a Pan Am paycheck, on July 30, 1970, in Durham, North Carolina, he again came to the attention of the FBI. He was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia, three months later, on November 2, 1970, after cashing 10 fake Pan Am payroll checks in different towns. Abagnale escaped from the Cobb County jail and was picked up four days later in New York City. He was sentenced to ten years in 1971 for forging checks that totaled $1,448.60 (equivalent to $11,225.45 in 2024), and he received an additional two years for escaping from the local Cobb County jailhouse.
In 1974, Abagnale was released on parole after he had served around two years of his 12-year sentence at Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg, Virginia. Unwilling to return to his family in New York, Abagnale says he left the choice of parole location up to the court, which decided that he would be paroled in Houston, Texas.
After his release, Abagnale stated that he performed numerous jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist; he was fired from most of those after he was discovered to have been hired without revealing his criminal past. He again posed as a pilot in 1974 to obtain a job at Camp Manison, a summer children's camp in Texas, where he was arrested for stealing cameras from his co-workers. After he received only a fine, he obtained a position at a Houston-area orphanage by pretending to be a pilot with a master's degree. This job had him finding foster homes for the children living at the orphanage. This ruse was eventually discovered by his parole officer, who swiftly removed him from his orphanage work and moved him into living quarters above his own garage, so he ""could keep an eye on him"". His next position was at Aetna, where he was fired and sued for check fraud.
According to Abagnale, he approached a bank with an offer in 1975. He explained to the bank what he had done and offered to speak to the bank's staff and show them various tricks that ""paperhangers"" use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his information helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $50, with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks. With that, he began a new career as a speaker and security consultant. During this time, he falsified his resume to show he had worked with the Los Angeles Police Department and Scotland Yard.
In 1977, Abagnale gave public talks wherein he claimed that between the ages of 16 and 21, he was a pediatrician in a Georgia hospital for one year, an assistant state attorney general for one year, a sociology professor for two semesters, and a Pan American airlines pilot for two years. In addition, Abagnale claimed that he recruited female university students as Pan American flight attendants, traveling with them for three months throughout Europe. He also claimed he eluded the FBI with a daring escape from a commercial airline bathroom via the toilet bowl, while the plane was taxiing at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. In 1978, Abagnale told a Honolulu Advertiser reporter that he was familiar with the toilet apparatus, squeezed himself through the opening, swung down through the lower hatch, landed on the pavement, ran across the runway, and hailed a cab. Abagnale claimed he moved the sewage container aside and that no one heard a thing: ""I took off running. I thought they were right behind me. What I didn't know was that the door was spring loaded and when it slammed shut the whole assembly fell back into place. Nobody heard anything because of the engines' roar.""
He moved with his wife, Kelly, and their three sons to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He and his family lived in the same house for the next 25 years. After their sons left home for college and careers elsewhere, Kelly suggested that she and Frank leave Tulsa. They decided to move to Charleston, South Carolina.
In 1976, he founded Abagnale & Associates, which advises companies on secure documents. In 2015, Abagnale was named the AARP Fraud Watch Ambassador, where he helps ""to provide online programs and community forums to educate consumers about ways to protect themselves from identity theft and cybercrime."" In 2018, he began co-hosting the AARP podcast The Perfect Scam about scammers and how they operate.
He has appeared in the media a variety of times, including three times as a guest on The Tonight Show, an appearance on To Tell the Truth in 1977, and a regular slot on the British network TV series The Secret Cabaret in the 1990s. The book about Abagnale, Catch Me If You Can, was turned into a movie of the same name by Steven Spielberg in 2002, featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. The real Abagnale made a cameo appearance in this film playing a French police officer taking DiCaprio into custody.


== Veracity of claims ==
During his many speeches, appearances and interviews on television, Abagnale has alleged many criminal exploits. These include stating that he was wanted in 26 countries, has worked extensively for the FBI, and escaped several times from FBI custody. He also claimed that he cashed over 17,000 bad checks, amounting to US$2.5 million, and worked as an assistant attorney general and a hospital physician. In addition, he stated that he started a fake stewardess trainee program, traveling with them throughout Europe for two months, and logged over three million air miles disguised as a pilot. Almost all of these claims have been refuted by journalists.
In public lectures describing his life story, Abagnale has consistently maintained that he was ""arrested just once,"" and that was in Montpellier, France. However, public records show Abagnale was arrested in New York (multiple times), California, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas.
Despite public records showing Abagnale targeted individuals and small family businesses, Abagnale has long claimed publicly that he ""never, ever ripped off any individuals."" He made the same claim of never targeting individuals and small businesses to BBC journalist Sarah Montague and the Associated Press. According to Abagnale, the only individual he ever swindled was a Miami prostitute: ""She tried to charge me $1,000 for an evening, so I gave her a $1,400 forged cashier's check, and got $400 in change."" In 2002, Abagnale told the Star Tribune, ""As long as I didn't hurt anyone, people never considered me a real criminal, my victims were big corporations. I was a kid ripping off the establishment.""
Individuals criminally targeted by Abagnale, however, have described the long-term consequences of victimization:

He had a key to our front door, it was never recovered. We changed the lock. I fed him. I cooked. I don't trust people as much anymore.
His claim that he passed the Louisiana bar examination, worked for Attorney General Jack P. F. Gremillion, and closed 33 cases, was challenged by several journalists in 1978. No record has been found of Abagnale ever being a member of the Louisiana Bar, and no evidence shows he ever worked as an assistant attorney general in Louisiana's Attorney General's Office. In 1978, the Louisiana State Bar Association reconciled all those who took the bar exam and concluded that Abagnale never took the exam using his own name or an alias; the State Attorney General's Office examined payments to all employees during the time Abagnale claimed he worked there and concluded that he never worked in the office using his name or an alias. After Abagnale appeared on The Tonight Show, then-First Assistant Attorney General Ken DeJean gave a reporter a series of questions to ask Abagnale about the description of then-Attorney General Gremillion. Abagnale failed to answer the questions correctly.

The man is not an imposter, he is a liar.
Abagnale claimed that when he was 18 years old, he worked for a year as a supervising pediatrician at the Cobb General Hospital in Marietta, Georgia. He maintained that he worked the midnight-to-8 am shift, supervising seven residents and 42 nurses. Abagnale claimed that he would visit the university library to memorize medical journals and textbooks: ""With my photographic memory, I could easily memorize anything. That did not mean that I could comprehend it, but I could rattle it off verbatim."" Abagnale told his audiences that over the course of his one year at Cobb General, no one doubted his position as a physician: ""So I made the rounds, picked up the clipboards, scribbled a few lines, initialed them, and everyone thought I was doing a fine job."" However, hospital administrators told journalist Ira Perry that the hospital had no midnight-to-8 am shift, nor did the position of regular overnight pediatrician exist, at the time. Using records from the New York State Archives, author Alan C. Logan demonstrated that Abagnale was in the Great Meadow Prison, in Comstock, New York, when he was 18.
Abagnale's claim that he impersonated a doctor is not entirely without foundation, however. On the University of Arizona campus in 1970, he stated that he was a pilot and a doctor. According to Paul Holsen, who was an older university student and licensed commercial pilot at the time, Abagnale informed him that he was there on behalf of Pan Am to recruit and conduct physical examinations on candidates. In his autobiography, Holsen claimed that after Abagnale's ruse was discovered, authorities informed him that Abagnale had indeed conducted physical exams on students. University of Arizona officials acknowledge that Abagnale had interacted with 12 female students. Abagnale has openly acknowledged that he performed examinations on young women while impersonating a doctor: ""When the girls came by, I always gave them a thorough examination and sent them on their way. I was young, but not stupid."" In 2021, Louisiana State University Manship Chair in Journalism Robert Mann expressed his regret in not confronting Abagnale's claim of conducting physical examinations as a doctor: ""Looking back on my story about the event [Abagnale's lecture], I am embarrassed by what I wrote about Abagnale's time posing as a pediatrician. Reading those words now, in which Abagnale bragged about sexual abuse, makes me sick.""
Abagnale has publicly claimed an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 140: ""I have an I.Q. of 140 and retain 90% of what I read. So, by studying and memorizing the bar exam, I was able to get the needed score."" In 2021, Abagnale gave the keynote speech at the American Mensa Conference in Houston. The organizers claimed he was the subject of an FBI manhunt and cashed millions of dollars' worth of checks while impersonating a pilot and doctor. Despite claims of a photographic memory, when queried by USA Today journalist Andy Seiler regarding details of his imposter roles and movements in the 1960s, Abagnale responded by saying, ""You get to a point in your life where you go, 'I don't remember what I did.'""
One of Abagnale's most notable claims was an alleged escape from the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, in 1971:

I was in one of the largest maximum-security federal prisons for two weeks when I impersonated a prison inspector and walked out, right past the machine guns and the guards.
In 1982, Abagnale told the press, ""I was and still am the only and youngest man to escape from that prison."" The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed, though, that Abagnale was never housed in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary: ""He was never admitted, so I don't really see how he could have escaped,"" said acting Warden Dwight Amstutz.
In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anticrime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Telephone calls to banks, schools, hospitals, and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was, ""Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information."" He later said he had changed the names.
Further doubts were raised about Abagnale's story after an October 1978 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, with a news article saying:

Abagnale is indeed a convicted confidence artist. But he is finding willing believers as he promotes and invents a more varied criminal past.
In December 1978, Abagnale's claims were again investigated after he visited Oklahoma City for a talk. As part of his investigation into the story, Perry spoke with Pan Am spokesman Bruce Haxthausen, who responded to the journalists' inquiry saying:

This is the first we've heard of this, and we would have heard of or at least remember[ed] it if it had happened. You don't forget $2.5 million in bad checks. I'd say this guy is as phony as a $3 bill.
In 2002, Abagnale addressed the issue of his story's lack of truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website, which said in part: ""I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also overdramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography."" However, Abagnale made the primary claims of working as a doctor for a year, an attorney for a year, a PhD professor, and his several escapes on national television in 1977 on the show To Tell the Truth and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, which antedated the 1980 autobiography by several years. He also made these claims in print media, namely the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, three years before the publication of his co-written autobiography, effectively nullifying the claim his aforementioned co-author, Stan Redding, exaggerated the story.
Despite Abagnale's website claim about his autobiography co-author Stan Redding, investigative journalist Javier Leiva discovered an obscure cover story of True Detective (January 1978) in which Abagnale told the story of his life. In True Detective, Abagnale claimed to Redding that he passed the Louisiana bar exam, worked as an assistant attorney general, was employed as a sociology professor, worked as an Atlanta pediatrician, escaped from an airplane toilet, escaped from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, recruited University of Arizona students (and traveled with them throughout Europe for weeks), and cashed $2.5 million in checks. These claims antedate, by several years, the co-authored autobiography, and they also demonstrate that it was Abagnale who invented and exaggerated his life story, not Stan Redding.
In 2002, at the Catch Me If You Can film premiere, Abagnale conceded to journalist Andy Seiler of USA Today that the impersonations in the autobiography were fabricated: ""I impersonated a doctor for a few days, I was a lawyer for a few days. In the book, it's like I am doing this for a year."" Despite this admission, in public speeches, Abagnale would return to his claims of long-term impersonations of a doctor and for working for a year as an attorney. Abagnale's fees for speaking about his alleged life story are reported to be between $20,000 and $30,000.
In 2006, KSL journalist Scott Haws challenged Abagnale with his claim that he worked as a PhD-holding sociology professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) for two semesters. Abagnale claimed that he could not recall the details, and that his co-author Redding had exaggerated some things. Haws ""refreshed Frank's memory"" and showed him his own words, including the Catch Me If You Can movie book and the credits that rolled at the end of the film Catch Me If You Can, where Abagnale, not Redding, made the BYU professor claim. Abagnale conceded to Haws that he might have been a guest lecturer.

So despite claiming to be a sociology professor in at least three books, two solely written by Abagnale himself, and an on-camera claim following the movie, it appears Abagnale as a BYU professor is mostly or entirely just another real fake.
Leading up to 2020, author Alan C. Logan conducted an in-depth investigation for a book that focused on the perspective of Abagnale's victims. As part of this process, Logan combined earlier newspaper articles, numerous administrative documents, and public records that had not been the subject of scrutiny by major media outlets. Based on these documents, Logan provided a timeline that challenged the overall truthfulness of Abagnale's self-described criminal history and movements between 1964 and 1974. Logan maintains that his investigation found that Abagnale's account of his criminal past is, for the most part, a fabrication. Using records from the New York State Archives, Logan showed that Abagnale was in Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York, between the ages of 17 and 20 (July 26, 1965, and December 24, 1968) as inmate #25367, the time frame during which Abagnale claims to have committed his most significant scams. Logan's investigation uncovered numerous petty crimes that Abagnale has never acknowledged. Various media outlets have asked Abagnale to respond to Logan's book content, which included victim statements and citations to publicly accessible records. Abagnale has responded by stating that the book is ""not worthy of a comment"".

Abagnale has told the press, ""I was convicted on $2.5 million dollars' worth of bad checks"" and that he later hired a law firm to get all the money back to hotels and other companies. Federal court records, though, show that Abagnale was convicted of forging 10 Pan American Airlines checks in five states (Texas, Arizona, Utah, California. and North Carolina), totaling less than US$1,500. Following his parole on February 8, 1974, he claimed he went to work for the FBI, but after this date, Abagnale was arrested for theft at a kids' camp in Friendswood, Texas, on August 29, 1974.
In many interviews and speeches, Abagnale has claimed that he has earned millions of dollars from his patents. The United States Patent and Trademark Office website, to the contrary, does not list Abagnale—as a person—or Abagnale and Associates—as a business—as holders of any patents, and neither are listed as an inventor on any patent. In his cheque design patents, Canadian inventor Calin A. Sandru merely mentions in the Background section of the invention that KPMG and Abagnale and Associates are groups that affirm that cheque fraud is a significant problem.
Logan, girded with public records, shared his findings in detail on the NPR program Watching America, August 13, 2021, broadcast on WHRO.
In 2022, investigative journalist Javier Leiva independently obtained the public records first sourced by Logan. Leiva also confirmed that Abagnale was in prison between 17 and 20 and then convicted for theft in Baton Rouge in June 1969. Leiva also obtained the federal records connected to Abagnale's Pan Am checks and confirmed that his conviction, at 22 years old, was based on less than $1,500. Leiva says he calculated that between 1965 and 1970, Abagnale was only free for a matter of months and that his records show he was in prison most of that time. On June 23, 2022, Leiva confronted Abagnale at the Connect IT Global 2022 conference in Las Vegas with prison and other public records in-hand. Leiva describes these events in his podcast series Pretend – The Real Catch Me If You Can (Part 1).


=== Relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ===
One of Abagnale's most controversial claims is his relationship with the FBI. In 1977, when Abagnale began claiming a five-year uninterrupted life on the run, involving multiprofession imposter scams, he did not claim to work for the FBI. He did, however, leverage the names of FBI personnel to bolster his new biographical claims. In 1978, journalist Ira Perry determined that Abagnale and his publicist were giving out the names of FBI agents to any party that asked for references or verification of his claimed biography; in particular, they gave out the name of Robert Russ Franck, who they claimed was the ""former Atlanta agent"" who knew all about Abagnale. When Perry contacted Franck, who had just retired as head of the FBI's Houston Division, and had never worked in Atlanta, Franck told him:

That damn Abagnale uses my name all over the place, but I've never even met the guy.Franck informed Perry that he had only heard about Abagnale through people attempting to verify his biographical claims, and was unable to confirm whether the claims were true. Perry also interviewed Eugene Stewart, a retired FBI agent who was in charge of the Atlanta division when Abagnale claimed he was a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta. Stewart, who at this point was Delta Air Lines chief of security, informed Perry that Abagnale was a low-level criminal: ""It's more of a harassment than anything else,"" said Stewart. In addition, Stewart noted that Abagnale had been using a Delta Air Lines uniform to cash bad personal checks in Texas after his 1974 parole. After his parole, Abagnale was arrested for theft from a children’s camp in Friendswood, Texas. Public records show that almost two years after his parole, in October 1975, Abagnale was hired by Aetna Insurance, and was abruptly fired by the company after he allegedly cashed bad personal checks during his employee training. Aetna eventually filed suit against Abagnale after his appearance on To Tell the Truth was broadcast in 1977.
After the publication of his 1980 autobiography, Abagnale began to inform his audiences that he was on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He carried this claim into the '90s: ""I was the only teenager in the history of the FBI to be put on their 10 Most Wanted list,"" Abagnale told his audiences in 1994. In the lead up to the release of the film Catch Me If You Can, this ""Ten Most Wanted Fugitives"" claim was used in marketing for the film. Pressed on this claim when the film was released, and with evidence clearly showing the absence of Abagnale on any most wanted list, he conceded on his website that he was never on the FBI's Most Wanted list.
In 2002, Los Angeles Times journalist Bob Baker (1948–2015) reported that no FBI task force was set up to capture Abagnale. Despite his claims that he was living in the infamous Riverbend Apartments, supposedly eluding the FBI for one year as a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta, the newspaper report of Abagnale's arrest indicated he had been in the area for only two days; local FBI agents responded to a tip that Abagnale was in a local hotel and arrested him there. In September 2022, retired FBI Agent Alan Brown obtained permission from FBI headquarters to discuss his arrest of Abagnale. Brown spoke to investigative journalist Javier Leiva and acknowledged that the Atlanta field office simply acted on a teletype request to pick Abagnale up at the Squire Inn, in Marietta, Georgia. In contrast to Abagnale's claims about escaping from the hotel, as depicted in the film, Brown stated that Abagnale was arrested in his room without incident. Brown also stated that he had no personal knowledge of Abagnale's arrests prior to 1970, and after 1970, when Abagnale was arrested in Friendswood, Texas.
In the years following the release of Catch Me if You Can, Abagnale began claiming that he was granted a unique parole from the federal prison in Petersburg, Virginia, so that he could work for the bureau: ""When the FBI took me out of prison, it was to do undercover work."" Abagnale has claimed that the clandestine work was given to him directly by Clarence M. Kelley, who directed the FBI from 1973 to 1978. In his ""Talks at Google"" lecture, Abagnale claimed that because of his photographic memory, Kelley asked him to memorize the components of military hardware and infiltrate bases as a lieutenant. Abagnale describes Kelley's instructions this way: ""Okay, you are a lieutenant in the army. You have been in the army this many years. Your expertise is this missile. I need you to learn all of this in two weeks, and I'm sending you to this base, and I want you to find out what's going on in this particular area."" In the lecture, Abagnale also claims Kelley sent him on similar missions ""as a scientist at a lab in New Mexico.""
Jerri Williams, a retired FBI agent who specialized in white-collar crime and fraud, spoke to investigative journalist Javier Leiva about these claims. Williams rejected Abagnale's claims of being tasked with clandestine operations directly by Kelley:

If anybody tells you that they got an assignment directly from the FBI director, right from the head of the FBI, you know for a fact it's bullshit. It doesn't happen that way.
After the film was released, Abagnale began to use the first-person plural pronoun ""we"" to refer to the FBI; he also began to inform audiences that he was directly working for the FBI and celebrating each anniversary of his unique parole and the opportunity to go to work at the FBI; for example, in 2006, he informed his audiences, ""This year I am celebrating 31 years with the FBI,"" in 2014, he told his audiences, ""this year I'm celebrating 38 years at the FBI where I work today."" The dates of this anniversary celebration point to 1976 and do not line up with Abagnale's claim of a parole-release deal. Abagnale was, according to United States Board of Parole and Federal Bureau of Prisons standard practice at the time, sent to a pre-release center in Houston in 1973, within the 120 days prior to his actual federal parole date of February 8, 1974.
Ira Winkler, former intelligence analyst for the United States Department of Defense, and chief security architect for Walmart stores internationally, describes an encounter with Abagnale. Winkler queried Abagnale on the specifics of his position at the FBI. Abagnale responded that he was, ""a special agent"". Winkler says, ""You mean a full-fledged special agent?"", to which Abagnale responded in the affirmative.
In a 2018 interview broadcast on PBS, Abagnale publicly criticized former FBI director James Comey for his unprofessionalism during the 2016 US presidential election. In the same interview, Abagnale claims that the FBI is concerned that he is of retirement age: ""The FBI always ask me when am I going to retire, because they don't want me to,"" said Abagnale. In interviews, Abagnale has claimed that his work with the FBI is pro bono, although he has claimed publicly that his company has made millions of dollars from contracts with the U.S. government: ""Today, Frank Abagnale and Associates does $10.5 million of business per year, 90% of it with the federal government,"" he told his audience in 1988. In 1991, Frank Abagnale and his wife Kelly filed for bankruptcy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the court filings, Abagnale claimed that he had $1.6 million in debts and $308,000 in assets.
Journalist Ira Perry was unable to find any evidence that Abagnale worked with the FBI; according to one retired FBI special agent in charge, Abagnale was caught trying to pass personal checks in 1978 several years after he claimed that he began working with the FBI. Dating back to the 1980s, Abagnale claimed that Joseph Shea, an FBI agent, had pursued him for five years (between 1965 and 1970). Abagnale claimed that Shea befriended and supervised him during his parole. When Catch Me If You Can was released in theatres, though, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Abagnale and Shea only reunited in the late 1980s, almost 20 years after Shea arrested him. Abagnale spotted Shea at an anticrime seminar in Kansas City and sought out Shea to shake his hand.
When the film was released, an FBI spokesperson acknowledged that Abagnale had given lectures at the academy ""from time to time,"" but denied that Abagnale had been given commendations by the agency as claimed in the film's marketing. At no point has the FBI made an official statement corroborating Abagnale's biographical claims, nor has the agency confirmed his extraordinary claims that he was sent into a military base as an expert on missiles, and into a secret lab in New Mexico. Abagnale has claimed in public lectures that he was discussed in detail in a coffee-table book celebrating 100 years of the FBI. However, Abagnale's name does not appear anywhere in the official book celebrating 100 years of the FBI. In his public lectures, Abagnale has taken on a pseudo-spokesperson role for the FBI. In discussing recruitments, he states, ""currently [2017] we take 1 in 10,000 applications."" Abagnale made this same claim of 1 in 10,000 applications to Idaho Statesman journalist Michael Katz in 2019. Overall approximately 11,500 applications per year are made for 900 positions at the FBI (2018 statistics), which is about one in 13 applicants.
In 2020, Abagnale was confronted by one of his victims in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When asked why he talks about being an attorney general and passing the state's bar exam, and yet failing to acknowledge his arrest and conviction in Baton Rouge, Abagnale said, ""That's because I work for the FBI."" Abagnale claimed to the Star Tribune that he is an ethics instructor at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia: ""I teach ethics at the FBI academy, which is ironic, but years ago, someone at the bureau said, 'Who better than you to do this?'—I try to teach young agents the importance of doing the right thing.""


=== Talks at Google ===
In August 2022, Google disabled all comments and added a disclaimer to Abagnale's ""Talks at Google"", which now states: ""Disclaimer: Google does not endorse or condone the content contained within this video, nor does it lay claim to the validity of the actions described herein. The following is presented unaltered as it was recorded on Nov 27, 2017, and remains on the Talks at Google YouTube channel for historical purposes."" In the video disclaimer Google did not provide an explicit reason for the abnegation of Abagnale's video or whether or not it was part of their new initiative to work with journalists to combat misinformation and disinformation. However, according to investigative journalist Javier Leiva, the move was made in response to members of his audience.


=== Controversy at Xavier and other universities ===
On September 12, 2022, Frank Abagnale was awarded the ""Heroes in Ethics"" award by Xavier University, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Abagnale gave the keynote lecture at the university's annual Heroes of Professional Ethics series. At the conclusion of his talk, Abagnale invited the audience to ask him any questions on any matter. A member of the audience, Jim Grinstead, the host of the podcast Scams and Cons, asked Abagnale, ""So I wonder, in light of the ethics award you're going to be presented tonight, would you come clean? Would you tell the truth about the stories you've told? Will you admit that you just lied to everybody, and you're still conning them?"" In his response Abagnale denied telling any lies or spreading any misinformation. He claimed he had nothing to do with his autobiography, the film, and the Broadway musical. Xavier University has removed any discussion of the September 12 event from its website.
The incident at Xavier University was not the first time Abagnale's story caused controversy on a university campus. In 1981, after criminal-justice professor William Toney and his students debunked Abagnale's biographical claims, several universities cancelled Abagnale's appearances. In an attempt to provide compromise, the University of South Carolina asked Abagnale to sign an affidavit that would attest to the truthfulness of his biographical claims. The university informed Abagnale that he would still be allowed to give the speech and collect his speaking fee, even if he did not sign the affidavit, but if he refused, the university would warn the students at the outset of the speech that Abagnale had not promised to tell the truth. Abagnale refused to sign the affidavit, referring to the document as a ""slap in the face"".
As skepticism of Abagnale's story spread, he cancelled his own university bookings. In a letter to Georgia Southwestern State University, Abagnale wrote that it was wrong to profit from his criminal past by speaking about it to college campuses. Furthermore, in the letter to GSSU, Abagnale stated that he was cancelling all college speaking engagements because the criminal aspects of the life story he was presenting ""[are] not something to which young impressionable minds should be exposed."" In the midst of this controversy, Abagnale was queried by journalist John Dagley, who asked him if his biography was a lie, to which he replied:

""Well, then, I am the world's greatest con man. As one gentleman said to me, 'If you didn't do all those things, and you've made all this money you've made in advances, royalties, and speaking engagements, then you are in fact the world's greatest con man.'""


== Personal life ==
Abagnale and his wife Kelly live on Daniel Island, an island community which is part of Charleston, South Carolina. They have three children. Abagnale maintains that meeting his wife was the motivation for changing his life. He told author Paul Stenning that he met her while allegedly working undercover for the FBI when she was a cashier at a grocery store.

"In computing, Internet geolocation is software capable of deducing the geographic position of a device connected to the Internet. For example, the device's IP address can be used to determine the country, city, or ZIP code, determining its geographical location. Other methods include examination of Wi-Fi hotspots.


== Data sources ==
An IP address is assigned to each device (e.g. computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains, among other things, the IP address of the sender.
There are a number of free and paid subscription geolocation databases, ranging from country level to state or city—including ZIP/post code level—each with varying claims of accuracy (generally higher at the country level). These databases typically contain IP address data, which may be used in firewalls, ad servers, routing, mail systems, websites, and other automated systems where a geolocation may be useful. An alternative to hosting and querying a database is to obtain the country code for a given IP address through a DNSBL-style lookup from a remote server.
Some commercial databases have augmented geolocation software with demographic data to enable demographic-type targeting using IP address data.
The primary source for IP address data is the regional Internet registries which allocates and distributes IP addresses amongst organizations located in their respective service regions:

African Network Information Centre (AfriNIC)
American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)
Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)
Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry (LACNIC)
RIPE Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)
The registries allow assignees to specify country and geographical coordinates of each assigned block. Starting from 2021 RFC 9092 allows assignees to specify location of any IP subnetwork they own.
Secondary sources include:

Data mining or user-submitted geographic location data:
Website-submitted, e.g. a weather website asking visitors for a city name to find their local forecast or pairing a user's IP address with the address information in their account profile.
Wi-Fi positioning system through the examination of neighborhood Wi-Fi BSSID. E.g. Mozilla Location Service.
Examination of neighborhood Bluetooth devices.
Pairing a user's IP address with the GPS location of a device that's using such an IP address.
Data contributed by Internet service providers.
Guesstimates from adjacent Class C range and/or gleaned from network hops.
Network routing information collected to the end point of the IP address.
Analysis of linguistic data from the device, using pre-trained models that show that some term is frequently mentioned in a certain location (e.g. ""the T"" vs ""the El"" vs. ""the subway"").
Accuracy is improved by:

Data scrubbing to filter out or identify anomalies.
Statistical analysis of user submitted data.
Utilizing third-party tests conducted by reputable organizations.


=== Errors ===
If geolocation software maps IP addresses associated with an entire county or territory to a particular location, such as the geographic center of the territory, this can cause considerable problems for the people who happen to live there, as law enforcement authorities and others may mistakenly assume any crimes or other misconduct associated with the IP address to originate from that particular location.
For example, a farmstead northeast of Potwin, Kansas became the default site of 600 million IP addresses when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company MaxMind changed the putative geographic center of the contiguous United States from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000. Since 2012, a family in Pretoria, South Africa, has been regularly visited by police or angry private citizens who believed their stolen phones were to be found in the family's backyard. This was also the result of geolocation by MaxMind. The company used the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's coordinates for Pretoria, which pointed to the family's house, to represent IP addresses associated with Pretoria.


== Privacy ==
A distinction can be made between co-operative and oppositional geolocation. In some cases, it is in the interest of users to be accurately located, for example, so that they can be offered information relevant to their location. In other cases, users prefer not to disclose their location for privacy or other reasons.
Technical measures for ensuring anonymity, such as proxy servers, can be used to circumvent restrictions imposed by geolocation software. Some sites detect the use of proxies and anonymizers, and may either block service or provide non-localized content in response.


== Applications ==
Geolocation technology has been under development only since 1999, and the first patents were granted in 2004. The technology is already widely used in multiple industries, including e-retail, banking, media, telecommunications, education, travel, hospitality, entertainment, health care, online gaming and law enforcement, for preventing online fraud, complying with regulations, managing digital rights  and serving targeted marketing content and pricing. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed that geolocation software might be leveraged to support 9-1-1 location determination.


=== Criminal investigations ===
Banks, software vendors and other online enterprises in the US and elsewhere became subject to strict ""know your customer"" laws imposed by the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and other regulatory entities in the US and Europe from the early twenty-first century. These laws are intended to prevent money laundering, trafficking with terrorist organizations, and trading with banned nations. When it is possible to identify the true location of online visitors, geolocation can protect banks from participating in the transfer of funds for illicit purposes.  More and more prosecuting bodies are bringing cases involving cyber-crimes such as cyber-stalking and identity theft. Prosecutors often have the capability of determining the IP address data necessary to link a computer to a crime.

Online retailers and payment processors use geolocation to detect possible credit card fraud by comparing the user's location to the billing address on the account or the shipping address provided. A mismatch – an order placed from the US on an account number from Tokyo, for example – is a strong indicator of potential fraud. IP address geolocation can be also used in fraud detection to match billing address postal code or area code. Banks can prevent ""phishing"" attacks, money laundering and other security breaches by determining the user's location as part of the authentication process. Whois databases can also help verify IP addresses and registrants.
Government, law enforcement and corporate security teams use geolocation as an investigatory tool, tracking the Internet routes of online attackers to find the perpetrators and prevent future attacks from the same location.


=== Geomarketing ===

Since geolocation software can get the information of user location, companies using geomarketing may provide web content or products that are famous or useful in that specific location. Advertisements and content on a website that uses geolocation software in the form of an API (also referred to as ""IP API"" or ""IP address geolocation API"") may be tailored to provide the information that a certain user wants.


=== Regional licensing ===
Internet movie vendors, online broadcasters who serve live streaming video of sporting events, or certain TV and music video sites that are licensed to broadcast their videos of episodes/music videos are permitted to serve viewers only in their licensed territories. By geolocating viewers, they can be certain of obeying licensing regulations. Online gambling websites must also know where their customers violate gambling laws, or risk doing so.
Jim Ramo, chief executive of movie distributor Movielink, said studios were aware of the shortcomings going in and have grown more confident now that the system has been shown to work.


=== Gaming ===
A location-based game is a type of pervasive game for smartphones or other mobile devices in which the gameplay evolves and progresses via a player's real-world location which is typically obtained by GPS functionality from the device.

Towards Street-Level Client-Independent IP Geolocation: Recent research paper explaining how to find a location from an IP address within 1 km
How accurate can IP Geolocation get?"
"In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, or on-path attack, is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, where in actuality the attacker has inserted themselves between the two user parties.
One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. In this scenario, the attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within range of a Wi-Fi access point hosting a network without encryption could insert themselves as a man in the middle.
As it aims to circumvent mutual authentication, a MITM attack can succeed only when the attacker impersonates each endpoint sufficiently well to satisfy their expectations. Most cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint authentication specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, TLS can authenticate one or both parties using a mutually trusted certificate authority.


== Example ==

Suppose Alice wishes to communicate with Bob. Meanwhile, Mallory wishes to intercept the conversation to eavesdrop (breaking confidentiality) with the option to deliver a false message to Bob under the guise of Alice (breaking non-repudiation). Mallory would perform a man-in-the-middle attack as described in the following sequence of events.

Alice sends a message to Bob, which is intercepted by Mallory:
Alice ""Hi Bob, it's Alice. Give me your key."" →     Mallory     Bob
Mallory relays this message to Bob; Bob cannot tell it is not really from Alice:
Alice     Mallory ""Hi Bob, it's Alice. Give me your key."" →     Bob
Bob responds with his encryption key:
Alice     Mallory     ← [Bob's key] Bob
Mallory replaces Bob's key with her own, and relays this to Alice, claiming that it is Bob's key:
Alice     ← [Mallory's key] Mallory     Bob
Alice encrypts a message with what she believes to be Bob's key, thinking that only Bob can read it:
Alice ""Meet me at the bus stop!"" [encrypted with Mallory's key] →     Mallory     Bob
However, because it was actually encrypted with Mallory's key, Mallory can decrypt it, read it, modify it (if desired), re-encrypt with Bob's key, and forward it to Bob:
Alice     Mallory ""Meet me at the park!"" [encrypted with Bob's key] →     Bob
Bob thinks that this message is a secure communication from Alice.
This example shows the need for Alice and Bob to have a means to ensure that they are truly each using each other's public keys, and not the public key of an attacker. Otherwise, such attacks are generally possible, in principle, against any message sent using public-key technology.


== Types of MITM ==
There are several attack types that can fall into the category of MITM. The most notable are:

HTTPS Spoofing: The attacker tricks the victim into believing their connection is secure by substituting a fake SSL/TLS certificate.
SSL/TLS Stripping: Downgrades HTTPS traffic to HTTP, intercepting and reading unencrypted data.
ARP Spoofing: Sends fake ARP messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with a target IP, intercepting local network traffic.
DNS Spoofing/Poisoning: Redirects DNS queries to malicious servers, leading victims to fake websites.
Session Hijacking: Steals session cookies or tokens to impersonate a legitimate user in an active session.
Man-in-the-Browser (MITB): Malware alters browser activity, intercepting or manipulating transactions in real-time.
Wi-Fi MITM (Evil Twin Attack): Creates a fake Wi-Fi hotspot to intercept communications from connected devices.
Email Hijacking: Intercepts email exchanges to manipulate or steal sensitive information.
Replay Attacks: Captures and retransmits valid data to repeat actions or disrupt communication.
Fake Certificate Authority (CA): Uses a fraudulent CA to sign fake certificates, tricking victims into trusting malicious connections.


== Defense and detection ==
MITM attacks can be prevented or detected by two means: authentication and tamper detection. Authentication provides some degree of certainty that a given message has come from a legitimate source. Tamper detection merely shows evidence that a message may have been altered and has broken integrity.


=== Authentication ===
All cryptographic systems that are secure against MITM attacks provide some method of authentication for messages. Most require an exchange of information (such as public keys) in addition to the message over a secure channel. Such protocols, often using key-agreement protocols, have been developed with different security requirements for the secure channel, though some have attempted to remove the requirement for any secure channel at all.
A public key infrastructure, such as Transport Layer Security, may harden Transmission Control Protocol against MITM attacks. In such structures, clients and servers exchange certificates which are issued and verified by a trusted third party called a certificate authority (CA). If the original key to authenticate this CA has not been itself the subject of a MITM attack, then the certificates issued by the CA may be used to authenticate the messages sent by the owner of that certificate. Use of mutual authentication, in which both the server and the client validate the other's communication, covers both ends of a MITM attack. If the server or client's identity is not verified or deemed as invalid, the session will end. However, the default behavior of most connections is to only authenticate the server, which means mutual authentication is not always employed and MITM attacks can still occur.
Attestments, such as verbal communications of a shared value (as in ZRTP), or recorded attestments such as audio/visual recordings of a public key hash are used to ward off MITM attacks, as visual media is much more difficult and time-consuming to imitate than simple data packet communication. However, these methods require a human in the loop in order to successfully initiate the transaction.
HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP), sometimes called ""certificate pinning"", helps prevent a MITM attack in which the certificate authority itself is compromised, by having the server provide a list of ""pinned"" public key hashes during the first transaction. Subsequent transactions then require one or more of the keys in the list must be used by the server in order to authenticate that transaction.
DNSSEC extends the DNS protocol to use signatures to authenticate DNS records, preventing simple MITM attacks from directing a client to a malicious IP address.


=== Tamper detection ===
Latency examination can potentially detect the attack in certain situations, such as with long calculations that lead into tens of seconds like hash functions. To detect potential attacks, parties check for discrepancies in response times. For example: Say that two parties normally take a certain amount of time to perform a particular transaction. If one transaction, however, were to take an abnormal length of time to reach the other party, this could be indicative of a third party's presence interfering with the connection and inserting additional latency in the transaction.
Quantum cryptography, in theory, provides tamper-evidence for transactions through the no-cloning theorem. Protocols based on quantum cryptography typically authenticate part or all of their classical communication with an unconditionally secure authentication scheme. As an example Wegman-Carter authentication.


=== Forensic analysis ===
Captured network traffic from what is suspected to be an attack can be analyzed in order to determine whether there was an attack and, if so, determine the source of the attack. Important evidence to analyze when performing network forensics on a suspected attack includes:

IP address of the server
DNS name of the server
X.509 certificate of the server
Whether the certificate has been self signed
Whether the  certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority
Whether the certificate has been revoked
Whether the certificate has been changed recently
Whether other clients, elsewhere on the Internet, received the same certificate


== Notable instances ==
A Stingray phone tracker is a cellular phone surveillance device that mimics a wireless carrier cell tower in order to force all nearby mobile phones and other cellular data devices to connect to it. The tracker relays all communications back and forth between cellular phones and cell towers. 
In 2011, a security breach of the Dutch certificate authority DigiNotar resulted in the fraudulent issuing of certificates. Subsequently, the fraudulent certificates were used to perform MITM attacks.
In 2013, Nokia's Xpress Browser was revealed to be decrypting HTTPS traffic on Nokia's proxy servers, giving the company clear text access to its customers' encrypted browser traffic. Nokia responded by saying that the content was not stored permanently, and that the company had organizational and technical measures to prevent access to private information.
In 2017, Equifax withdrew its mobile phone apps following concern about MITM vulnerabilities.
Bluetooth, a wireless communication protocol, has also been susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks due to its wireless transmission of data.
Other notable real-life implementations include the following:

DSniff –  the first public implementation of MITM attacks against SSL and SSHv1
Fiddler2 HTTP(S) diagnostic tool
NSA impersonation of Google
Superfish malware
Forcepoint Content Gateway –  used to perform inspection of SSL traffic at the proxy
Comcast uses MITM attacks to inject JavaScript code to 3rd party web pages, showing their own ads and messages on top of the pages

Finding Hidden Threats by Decrypting SSL Archived October 18, 2017, at the Wayback Machine (PDF). SANS Institute."
"The Madoff investment scandal was a major case of stock and securities fraud discovered in late 2008. In December of that year, Bernie Madoff, the former Nasdaq chairman and founder of the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, admitted that the wealth management arm of his business was an elaborate multi-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme.
Madoff founded Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960, and was its chairman until his arrest. The firm employed Madoff's brother Peter as senior managing director and chief compliance officer, Peter's daughter Shana Madoff as rules and compliance officer and attorney, and Madoff's sons Mark and Andrew. Peter was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and Mark died by suicide two years to the day after his father's arrest.
Alerted by Madoff's sons, federal authorities arrested Madoff on December 11, 2008. On March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal crimes and admitted to operating the largest Ponzi scheme in history. On June 29, 2009, he was sentenced to 150 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed, with restitution of $170 billion. He died in prison in 2021.
According to the original federal charges, Madoff said that his firm had ""liabilities of approximately US$50 billion."" Prosecutors estimated the size of the fraud to be $64.8 billion, based on the amounts in the accounts of Madoff's 4,800 clients as of November 30, 2008. Ignoring opportunity costs and taxes paid on fictitious profits, about half of Madoff's direct investors lost no money. Harry Markopolos, a whistleblower whose repeated warnings about Madoff were ignored, estimated that at least $35 billion of the money Madoff claimed to have stolen never really existed, but was simply fictional profits he reported to his clients.
Investigators determined that others were involved in the scheme. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was criticized for not investigating Madoff more thoroughly; questions about his firm had been raised as early as 1999. The legitimate trading arm of Madoff's business that was run by his two sons was one of the top market makers on Wall Street, and in 2008 was the sixth-largest.
Madoff's personal and business asset freeze created a chain reaction throughout the world's business and philanthropic community, forcing many organizations to at least temporarily close, including the Robert I. Lappin Charitable Foundation, the Picower Foundation, and the JEHT Foundation.


== Background ==
Madoff started his firm in 1960 as a penny stock trader with $5,000 ($53,144 in 2024), earned from working as a lifeguard and sprinkler installer, and $50,000 that he had borrowed from his in-laws ($531,440 in 2024). His fledgling business, which he founded with his high school sweetheart Ruth Alpern, began to grow with the assistance of his father-in-law, accountant Saul Alpern, who referred a circle of friends and their families.
Initially, the firm made markets (quoted bid and ask prices) via the National Quotation Bureau's Pink Sheets. To compete with firms that were members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  trading on the stock exchange's floor, his firm began using innovative computer information technology to disseminate quotes. After a trial run, the technology that the firm helped develop became Nasdaq. At one point, Madoff Securities was the largest buying-and-selling ""market maker"" at the Nasdaq.
He was active in the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), a self-regulatory securities industry organization, serving as the chairman of the board of directors and on the board of governors.
In 1992, Randall Smith of The Wall Street Journal described him as:

... one of the masters of the off-exchange ""third market"" and the bane of the New York Stock Exchange. He has built a highly profitable securities firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, which siphons a huge volume of stock trades away from the Big Board. The $740 million [$1.66 billion in 2024] average daily volume of trades executed electronically by the Madoff firm off the exchange equals 9% of the New York exchange's.  Mr. Madoff's firm can execute trades so quickly and cheaply that it actually pays other brokerage firms a penny a share to execute their customers' orders, profiting from the spread between bid and asked prices that most stocks trade for.
Several family members worked for him. His younger brother, Peter, was senior managing director and chief compliance officer, and Peter's daughter, Shana Madoff, was the compliance attorney. Madoff's sons, Mark and Andrew, worked in the trading section, along with Charles Weiner, Madoff's nephew. Andrew Madoff invested his own money in his father's fund, but Mark stopped in about 2001.
Federal investigators believe the fraud in the investment management division and advisory division may have begun in the 1970s. However, Madoff himself stated his fraudulent activities began in the 1990s. Madoff's fraudulent activities are believed to have accelerated after the 2001 change from fractional share trades to decimals on the NYSE, which cut significantly into his legitimate profits as a market-maker. With fractional trades Madoff profited up to 12.5 cents per share with each trade handled by his firm, but following decimalization this bid ask spread between sellers and buyers was reduced to as low as one cent.
In the 1980s, Madoff's market-maker division traded up to 5% of the total volume made on the NYSE. Madoff was ""the first prominent practitioner"" of payment for order flow, paying brokers to execute their clients' orders through his brokerage, a practice some have called a ""legal kickback"". This practice gave Madoff the distinction of being the largest dealer in NYSE-listed stocks in the U.S., trading about 15% of transaction volume. Academics have questioned the ethics of these payments. Madoff has argued that these payments did not alter the price that the customer received. He viewed payments for order flow as a normal business practice: ""If your girlfriend goes to buy stockings at a supermarket, the racks that display those stockings are usually paid for by the company that manufactured the stockings. Order flow is an issue that attracted a lot of attention but is grossly overrated.""
By 2000, Madoff Securities, one of the top traders of US securities, held approximately $300 million in assets ($548 million in 2024). The business occupied three floors of the Lipstick Building in Manhattan, with the investment management division on the 17th floor, referred to as the ""hedge fund"", employing a staff of fewer than 24. Madoff also ran a branch office in London that employed 28 people, separate from Madoff Securities. The company handled investments for his family of approximately £80 million. Two remote cameras installed in the London office permitted Madoff to monitor events from New York.
After 41 years as a sole proprietorship, Madoff converted his firm into a limited liability company in 2001, with himself as the sole shareholder.


== Modus operandi ==
In 1992, Bernard Madoff explained his purported strategy to The Wall Street Journal. He said his returns were really nothing special, given that the Standard & Poors 500-stock index generated an average annual return of 16.3% between November 1982 and November 1992. ""I would be surprised if anybody thought that matching the S&P over 10 years was anything outstanding."" The majority of money managers actually trailed the S&P 500 during the 1980s. The Journal concluded Madoff's use of futures and options helped cushion the returns against the market's ups and downs. Madoff said he made up for the cost of the hedges, which could have caused him to trail the stock market's returns, with stock-picking and market timing.


=== Purported strategy ===
Madoff's sales pitch was an investment strategy consisting of purchasing blue-chip stocks and taking options contracts on them, sometimes called a split-strike conversion or a collar. ""Typically, a position will consist of the ownership of 30–35 S&P 100 stocks, most correlated to that index, the sale of out-of-the-money 'calls' on the index and the purchase of out-of-the-money 'puts' on the index. The sale of the 'calls' is designed to increase the rate of return, while allowing upward movement of the stock portfolio to the strike price of the 'calls'. The 'puts', funded in large part by the sales of the 'calls', limit the portfolio's downside.""
In his 1992 ""Avellino and Bienes"" interview with The Wall Street Journal, Madoff discussed his supposed methods: In the 1970s, he had placed invested funds in ""convertible arbitrage positions in large-cap stocks, with promised investment returns of 18% to 20%"", and in 1982, he began using futures contracts on the stock index, and then placed put options on futures during the 1987 stock market crash. A few analysts performing due diligence had been unable to replicate the Madoff fund's past returns using historic price data for U.S. stocks and options on the indexes. Barron's raised the possibility that Madoff's returns were most likely due to front running his firm's brokerage clients.
Mitchell Zuckoff, professor of journalism at Boston University and author of Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend, says that ""the 5% payout rule"", a federal law requiring private foundations to pay out 5% of their funds each year, allowed Madoff's Ponzi scheme to go undetected for a long period since he managed money mainly for charities. Zuckoff notes, ""For every $1 billion in foundation investment, Madoff was effectively on the hook for about $50 million in withdrawals a year. If he was not making real investments, at that rate the principal would last 20 years. But by continuing to add new (if more volatile) investments, a Ponzi scheme built on that approach could thrive long into the future. [...] By targeting charities, Madoff could avoid the threat of sudden or unexpected withdrawals.""
In his guilty plea, Madoff admitted that he had not actually traded since the early 1990s, and all of his returns since then had been fabricated. However, David Sheehan, principal investigator for trustee Irving Picard, believes the wealth management arm of Madoff's business had been a fraud from the start.
Madoff's operation differed from a typical Ponzi scheme. While most Ponzi schemes are based on nonexistent businesses, Madoff's brokerage operation arm was very real. At the time of its shuttering, it handled large trades for institutional investors.


=== Sales methods ===
Madoff was a ""master marketer"" who, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, built a reputation as a wealth manager for a highly exclusive clientele. Investors who gained access, typically on word-of-mouth referral, believed that they had entered the inner circle of a money-making genius, and some were wary of removing their money from his fund, in case they could not get back in. In later years, even as Madoff's operation accepted money from various countries through feeder funds, he continued to package it as an exclusive opportunity. People who met him in person were impressed with his apparent humility despite his reported financial success and personal wealth.
A scheme that targets members of a particular religious or ethnic community is a type of affinity fraud, and a Newsweek article identified Madoff's scheme as ""an affinity Ponzi"". The New York Post reported that Madoff ""worked the so-called 'Jewish circuit' of well-heeled Jews he met at country clubs on Long Island and in Palm Beach."" The scandal so affected Palm Beach that, according to The Globe and Mail, residents ""stopped talking about the local destruction the Madoff storm caused only when Hurricane Trump came along"" in 2016. The New York Times reported that Madoff courted many prominent Jewish executives and organizations and, according to the Associated Press, they ""trusted [Madoff] because he is Jewish."" One of the most prominent promoters was J. Ezra Merkin, whose fund Ascot Partners steered $1.8 billion towards Madoff's firm.
Most Ponzi schemes appeal to greed, but Madoff appealed to investors' fear of volatility. His ""unusually consistent"" annual returns of around 10% were a key factor in perpetuating the fraud. Ponzi schemes typically pay returns of 20% or higher and collapse quickly. One Madoff fund, which described its ""strategy"" as focusing on shares in the Standard & Poor's 100-stock index, reported a 10.5% annual return during the previous 17 years. Even at the end of November 2008, amid a general market collapse, the same fund reported that it was up 5.6%, while the same year-to-date total return on the S&P 500-stock index had been negative 38%. Diana Henriques of the Times said that Madoff's victims could have made much more money in other investments

But they were willing to give up those greater returns in exchange for the consistency of Madoff's returns. He made them feel safe. They all thought they were taking a conservative step.
An unnamed investor remarked, ""The returns were just amazing, and we trusted this guy for decades — if you wanted to take money out, you always got your check in a few days. That's why we were all so stunned.""
The Swiss bank Union Bancaire Privée explained that because of Madoff's huge volume as a broker-dealer, the bank believed he had a perceived edge on the market because his trades were timed well, suggesting they believed he was front running.


=== Access to Washington ===
The Madoff family gained unusual access to Washington's lawmakers and regulators through the industry's top trade group. The Madoff family maintained long-standing, high-level ties to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the primary securities industry organization.
Bernard Madoff sat on the board of directors of the Securities Industry Association, which merged with the Bond Market Association in 2006 to form SIFMA. Madoff's brother Peter subsequently spent two terms on SIFMA's board. From 2000 to 2008, the brothers donated $56,000 to SIFMA, and also spent tens of thousands to sponsor SIFMA industry meetings. Peter resigned from the board in December 2008 as the Madoff scandal began to come to light and scrutiny of the brothers' relationship with SIFMA and regulators increased. 
In addition, Bernard Madoff's niece Shana Madoff who was the compliance officer and attorney at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities from 1995 until 2008, was active on the Executive Committee of SIFMA's Compliance & Legal Division, but resigned her SIFMA position shortly after her uncle's arrest. She in 2007 married former assistant director of the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations Eric Swanson, whom she had met in April 2003 while he was investigating her uncle Bernie Madoff and his firm. The two had periodic contact thereafter in connection with Swanson speaking at industry events organized by a SIFMA committee on which Shana Madoff sat. During 2003, Swanson sent Shana's father Peter Madoff two regulatory requests. In March 2004, SEC lawyer Genevievette Walker-Lightfoot, who was reviewing Madoff's firm, raised questions to Swanson (Walker-Lightfoot's boss's supervisor) about unusual trading at a Bernie Madoff fund; Walker-Lightfoot was told to instead concentrate on an unrelated matter. Swanson and Walker-Lightfoot's boss asked for her research, but did not act upon it. In February 2006, Swanson was emailed by Assistant Director John Nee that the SEC's New York Regional Office was investigating a complaint that Bernard Madoff might be running ""the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.""
In April 2006, Swanson began to date Shana Madoff. Swanson reported the relationship to his supervisor who wrote in an email ""I guess we won't be investigating Madoff anytime soon."" On 15 September 2006, Swanson left the SEC. On December 8, 2006, Swanson and Shana Madoff became engaged. In 2007, the two married. A spokesman for Swanson said he ""did not participate in any inquiry of Bernard Madoff Securities or its affiliates while involved in a relationship"" with Shana Madoff.


== Previous investigations ==
Madoff Securities LLC was investigated at least eight times over a 16-year period by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory authorities.


=== Avellino and Bienes ===
In 1992, the SEC investigated one of Madoff's feeder funds, Avellino & Bienes, the principals being Frank Avellino, Michael Bienes, and his wife Dianne Bienes. Bienes began his career working as an accountant for Madoff's father-in-law, Saul Alpern. Then, he became a partner in the accounting firm Alpern, Avellino and Bienes. In 1962, the firm began advising its clients about investing all of their money with a mystery man, a highly successful and controversial figure on Wall Street—but until this episode, not known as an ace money manager—Madoff. When Alpern retired at the end of 1974, the firm became Avellino and Bienes and continued to invest solely with Madoff.
Avellino & Bienes, represented by Ira Sorkin, Madoff's former attorney, were accused of selling unregistered securities. In a report to the SEC they mentioned the fund's ""curiously steady"" yearly returns to investors of 13.5% to 20%. However, the SEC did not look any more deeply into the matter, and never publicly referred to Madoff. Through Sorkin, who once oversaw the SEC's New York office, Avellino & Bienes agreed to return the money to investors, shut down their firm, undergo an audit, and pay a fine of $350,000. Avellino complained to the presiding federal judge, John E. Sprizzo, that Price Waterhouse fees were excessive, but the judge ordered him to pay the bill of $428,679 in full. Madoff said that he did not realize the feeder fund was operating illegally, and that his own investment returns tracked the previous 10 years of the S&P 500. The SEC investigation came right in the middle of Madoff's three terms as the chairman of the Nasdaq stock market board.
The size of the pools mushroomed by word-of-mouth, and investors grew to 3,200 in nine accounts with Madoff. Regulators feared it all might be just a huge scam. ""We went into this thinking it could be a major catastrophe. They took in nearly a half a billion dollars in investor money, totally outside the system that we can monitor and regulate. That's pretty frightening,"" said Richard Walker, who at the time was the SEC's New York regional administrator.
Avellino and Bienes deposited $454 million of investors' money with Madoff, and until 2007, Bienes continued to invest several million dollars of his own money with Madoff. In a 2009 interview after the scam had been exposed, he said, ""Doubt Bernie Madoff? Doubt Bernie? No. You doubt God. You can doubt God, but you don't doubt Bernie. He had that aura about him.""


=== SEC ===
The SEC investigated Madoff in 1999 and 2000 about concerns that the firm was hiding its customers' orders from other traders, for which Madoff then took corrective measures. In 2001, an SEC official met with Harry Markopolos at their Boston regional office and reviewed his allegations of Madoff's fraudulent practices. The SEC said it conducted two other inquiries into Madoff in the last several years, but did not find any violations or major issues of concern.
In 2004, after published articles appeared accusing the firm of front running, the SEC's Washington office cleared Madoff. The SEC detailed that inspectors had examined Madoff's brokerage operation in 2005, checking for three kinds of violations: the strategy he used for customer accounts; the requirement of brokers to obtain the best possible price for customer orders; and operating as an unregistered investment adviser. Madoff was registered as a broker-dealer, but doing business as an asset manager. ""The staff found no evidence of fraud"". In September 2005 Madoff agreed to register his business, but the SEC kept its findings confidential. During the 2005 investigation, Meaghan Cheung, a branch head of the SEC's New York's Enforcement Division, was the person responsible for the oversight and blunder, according to Markopolos, who testified on February 4, 2009, at a hearing held by a House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets.
In 2007, SEC enforcement completed an investigation they had begun on January 6, 2006, into a Ponzi scheme allegation. This investigation resulted in neither a finding of fraud, nor a referral to the SEC Commissioners for legal action.


=== FINRA ===
In 2007, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the industry-run watchdog for brokerage firms, reported without explanation that parts of Madoff's firm had no customers. ""At this point in time we are uncertain of the basis for FINRA's conclusion in this regard,"" SEC staff wrote shortly after Madoff was arrested.
As a result, the chairman of the SEC, Christopher Cox, stated that an investigation would delve into ""all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm"". A former SEC compliance officer, Eric Swanson, had married Madoff's niece Shana, the Madoff firm compliance attorney.


=== Other warnings ===
Outside analysts raised concerns about Madoff's firm for years. Mathematician Edward O. Thorp noted irregularities in 1991. Among other problems, Thorp found evidence Madoff was lying about or exaggerating his activities. While Madoff claimed to have purchased 123 call options for Procter & Gamble stock on April 16, 1991, Thorp later stated ""only 20 P&G options in total had changed hands that day.""
Rob Picard of the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), seeking low-volatility investments, was referred to Madoff in 1997 by employees of Tremont Group who were one of Madoff's key ""feeder funds"". When pressed for details of his investing strategy, Madoff ""stuttered"" and became evasive. Picard later stated: ""right away I realized he either didn't understand it or he wasn't doing what he said he was doing."" Suspecting fraud, RBC declined to invest with Madoff and also cut off professional contact with Tremont.
The next major concern about Madoff's operation was raised in May 2000, when Harry Markopolos, a financial analyst and portfolio manager at Boston options trader Rampart Investment Management, alerted the SEC about his suspicions. A year earlier, Rampart had learned that Access International Advisors, one of its trading partners, had significant investments with Madoff. Markopolos' bosses at Rampart asked him to design a product that could replicate Madoff's returns. However, Markopolos concluded that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. After four hours of trying and failing to replicate Madoff's returns, Markopolos concluded Madoff was a fraud. He told the SEC that based on his analysis of Madoff's returns, it was mathematically impossible for Madoff to deliver them using the strategies he claimed to use. In his view, there were only two ways to explain the figures—either Madoff was front running his order flow, or his wealth management business was a massive Ponzi scheme. This submission, along with three others, passed with no substantive action from the SEC. At the time of Markopolos' initial submission, Madoff managed assets from between $3 billion and $6 billion, which would have made his wealth management business the largest hedge fund in the world even then. The culmination of Markopolos' analysis was his third submission, a detailed 17-page memo entitled The World's Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud. He had also approached The Wall Street Journal about the existence of the Ponzi scheme in 2005, but its editors decided not to pursue the story. The memo specified 30 ""red flags"" based on a little over 14 years of Madoff trades. The biggest red flag was that Madoff reported only seven losing months during this time, and those losses were statistically insignificant. This result produced a return stream that rose steadily upward with almost no downticks, represented graphically by a nearly-perfect 45-degree angle. Markopolos argued that anyone who knows the math of the markets would know that such a distribution ""simply doesn't exist in finance,"" since the markets were far too volatile even under the best of conditions for this to be possible. Later, Markopolos testified before Congress that this would be like a baseball player batting .966 for the season, compared to .300 to .400 for elite players, ""and no one suspecting a cheat"". In part, the memo concluded: ""Bernie Madoff is running the world's largest unregistered hedge fund. He's organized this business as a 'hedge fund of funds' privately labeling their own hedge funds which Bernie Madoff secretly runs for them using a split-strike conversion strategy getting paid only trading commissions which are not disclosed. If this is not a regulatory dodge, I do not know what is."" Markopolos declared that Madoff's ""unsophisticated portfolio management"" was either a Ponzi scheme or front running (buying stock for his own account based on knowledge of his clients' orders), and concluded it was most likely a Ponzi scheme. Markopolos later testified to Congress that to deliver 12% annual returns to the investor, Madoff needed to earn an extraordinary 16% gross on a regular basis, so as to distribute a 4% fee to the feeder fund managers, whom Madoff needed to secure new victims, which encouraged the feeder funds to be ""willfully blind, and not get too intrusive"". Though Markopolos's findings were neglected by regulators he did persuade some professional investors. Joel Tillinghast, a mutual fund manager at Fidelity Investments, had been intrigued by anecdotes of Madoff's steady gains. But after a 2000 meeting with Markopolos he became convinced ""nothing in Madoff's ostensible strategy made sense.""
In 2001, financial journalist Erin Arvedlund wrote an article for Barron's entitled ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"", questioning Madoff's secrecy and wondering how he obtained such consistent returns. She reported that ""Madoff's investors rave about his performance – even though they don't understand how he does it. 'Even knowledgeable people can't really tell you what he's doing,' one very satisfied investor told Barron's."" The Barron's article and one in MARHedge by Michael Ocrant suggested Madoff was front-running to achieve his gains. In 2001 Ocrant, editor-in-chief of MARHedge, wrote he interviewed traders who were incredulous that Madoff had 72 consecutive gaining months, an unlikely possibility. Hedge funds investing with him were not permitted to name him as money manager in their marketing prospectus. When high-volume investors who were considering participation wanted to review Madoff's records for purposes of due diligence, he refused, convincing them of his desire to keep his proprietary strategies confidential.
By purportedly selling its holdings for cash at the end of each period, Madoff avoided filing disclosures of its holdings with the SEC, an unusual tactic. Madoff rejected any call for an outside audit ""for reasons of secrecy"", claiming that was the exclusive responsibility of his brother, Peter, the company's chief compliance officer.
Concerns were also raised that Madoff's auditor of record was Friehling & Horowitz, a two-person accounting firm based in suburban Rockland County that had only one active accountant, David G. Friehling, a close Madoff family friend. Friehling was also an investor in Madoff's fund, which was seen as a blatant conflict of interest. In 2007, hedge fund consultant Aksia advised its clients not to invest with Madoff, saying it was inconceivable that a tiny firm could adequately service such a massive operation.
Typically, hedge funds hold their portfolio at a securities firm (a major bank or brokerage), which acts as the fund's prime broker. This arrangement allows outside investigators to verify the holdings. Madoff's firm was its own broker-dealer, and purported to process all of its trades.
Ironically, Madoff, a pioneer in electronic trading, refused to provide his clients online access to their accounts. He sent out account statements by mail, unlike most hedge funds, which email statements.
Madoff also operated as a broker-dealer, running an asset management division. In 2003, Joe Aaron, a hedge-fund professional, believed the structure suspicious and warned a colleague to avoid investing in the fund, ""Why would a good businessman work his magic for pennies on the dollar?"" he concluded. Also in 2003, Renaissance Technologies, ""arguably the most successful hedge fund in the world"", reduced its exposure to Madoff's fund first by 50 percent and eventually completely because of suspicions about the consistency of returns, the fact that Madoff charged very little compared to other hedge funds, and the impossibility of the strategy Madoff claimed to use because options volume had no relation to the amount of money Madoff was said to administer. The options volume implied that Madoff's fund had $750 million, while he was believed to be managing $15 billion. And only if Madoff was assumed to be responsible for all the options traded in the most liquid strike price.
Charles J. Gradante, co-founder of hedge-fund research firm Hennessee Group, observed that Madoff ""only had five down months since 1996"", and commented on Madoff's investment performance: ""You can't go 10 or 15 years with only three or four down months. It's just impossible.""
Although Madoff's wealth management business ultimately grew into a multibillion-dollar operation, none of the major derivatives firms traded with him because they did not believe his numbers were real. None of the major Wall Street firms invested with him, and several high-ranking executives at those firms suspected his operations and claims were not legitimate. For example, hedge-fund manager Suzanne Murphy revealed that she balked at investing with Madoff because she did not believe there was enough volume to support his purported trading activity. 
Clients such as Fairfield Greenwich Group and Union Bancaire Privée said that they had been given an ""unusual degree of access"" to evaluate and analyze Madoff's funds, and found nothing unusual with his investment portfolio.
The Central Bank of Ireland failed to spot Madoff's gigantic fraud when he started using Irish funds, and had to supply large amounts of information that should have been enough to enable the Irish regulator to uncover the fraud much earlier than late 2008 when he was finally arrested in New York City.


== Final weeks and collapse ==
The scheme began to unravel in the fall of 2008, when the 2008 financial crisis accelerated. Madoff had previously come close to collapse in the second half of 2005 after Bayou Group, a group of hedge funds, was exposed as a Ponzi scheme that used a bogus accounting firm to misrepresent its performance. By November, investors had requested $105 million in redemptions, though Madoff's Chase account had only $13 million. Madoff survived by moving money from his broker-dealer's account into his Ponzi scheme account. Eventually, he drew on $342 million from his broker-dealer's credit lines to keep the Ponzi scheme afloat through 2006. Markopolos wrote that he suspected Madoff was on the brink of insolvency as early as June 2005, when his team learned he was seeking loans from banks. By then, at least two major banks were no longer willing to lend money to their customers to invest it with Madoff.
In June 2008, Markopolos' team uncovered evidence that Madoff was accepting leveraged money, investing with borrowed funds in an attempt to boost growth. To Markopolos' mind, Madoff was running out of cash and needed to increase his promised returns to keep the scheme going. As it turned out, redemption requests from skittish investors ramped up in the wake of the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008. The trickle became a flood when Lehman Brothers was forced into bankruptcy in September, coinciding with the near-collapse of American International Group.
Because investors had high confidence in Madoff and viewed their accounts as liquid assets, they withdrew from Madoff first when needing funds to repay their own investors' redemptions. As the market's decline accelerated, investors tried to withdraw $7 billion from the firm. Unknown to them, however, Madoff had simply deposited his clients' money into his business account at Chase Manhattan Bank, and paid customers out of that account when they requested withdrawals. To pay off those investors, Madoff needed new money from other investors. However, in November, the balance in the account dropped to dangerously low levels. Only $300 million in new money had come in, but customers had withdrawn $320 million. He had barely enough in the account to meet his redemption payroll on November 19. Even with a rush of new investors who believed Madoff was one of the few funds that was still doing well, it still was not enough to keep up with the avalanche of withdrawals.
In the weeks prior to his arrest, Madoff struggled to keep the scheme afloat. In November 2008, Madoff Securities International (MSIL) in London made two fund transfers to Bernard Madoff Investment Securities of approximately $164 million. MSIL had neither customers nor clients, and there is no evidence that it conducted any trades on behalf of third parties.
Madoff received $250 million around December 1, 2008, from Carl J. Shapiro, a 95-year-old Boston philanthropist and entrepreneur who was one of Madoff's oldest friends and biggest financial backers. On December 5, he accepted $10 million from Martin Rosenman, president of Rosenman Family LLC, who later sought to recover the never-invested $10 million, deposited in a Madoff account at JPMorgan, wired six days before Madoff's arrest. Judge Lifland ruled that Rosenman was ""indistinguishable"" from any other Madoff client, so there was no basis for giving him special treatment to recover funds. The judge separately declined to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Hadleigh Holdings, which claimed it entrusted $1 million to the Madoff firm three days before his arrest.
Madoff asked others for money in the final weeks before his arrest, including Wall Street financier Kenneth Langone, whose office was sent a 19-page pitch book, purportedly created by the staff at the Fairfield Greenwich Group. Madoff said he was raising money for a new investment vehicle, between $500 million and $1 billion for exclusive clients, was moving quickly on the venture, and wanted an answer by the following week. Langone declined. In November, Fairfield announced the creation of a new feeder fund. However, it was far too little and far too late.
By the week after Thanksgiving 2008, Madoff knew he was at the end of his tether. The Chase account, which at one point in 2008 had well over $5 billion, was down to only $234 million. With overall bank lending nearly at a standstill, Madoff knew he could not even begin to borrow enough money to meet the outstanding redemption requests. On December 4, he told Frank DiPascali, who oversaw the Ponzi scheme's operation, that he was finished. He directed DiPascali to use the remaining balance in the Chase account to cash out the accounts of relatives and favored investors. On December 9, he told his brother Peter that he was on the brink of collapse.
The following morning, December 10, he suggested to his sons, Mark and Andrew, that the firm pay out over $170 million in bonuses two months ahead of schedule, from $200 million in assets that the firm still had. According to the complaint, Mark and Andrew, reportedly unaware of the firm's pending insolvency, confronted their father, asking him how the firm could pay bonuses to employees if it could not pay investors. At that point, Madoff asked his sons to follow him to his apartment, where he admitted that he was ""finished"" and that the asset management arm of the firm was in fact a Ponzi scheme – as he put it, ""one big lie."" Mark and Andrew then reported him to the authorities.
Madoff intended to take a week to wind up the firm's operations before his sons alerted authorities. Instead, Mark and Andrew immediately called lawyers. When the sons revealed their father's plan to use the remaining money to pay relatives and favored investors, their lawyers put them in touch with federal prosecutors and the SEC. Madoff was arrested the following morning.


== Investigation into co-conspirators ==

Investigators looked for others involved in the scheme, despite Madoff's assertion that he alone was responsible for the large-scale operation. Harry Susman, an attorney representing several clients of the firm, stated that ""someone had to create the appearance that there were returns"", and further suggested that there must have been a team buying and selling stocks, forging books, and filing reports. James Ratley, president of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners said, ""In order for him to have done this by himself, he would have had to have been at work night and day, no vacation and no time off. He would have had to nurture the Ponzi scheme daily. What happened when he was gone? Who handled it when somebody called in while he was on vacation and said, 'I need access to my money'?""
""Simply from an administrative perspective, the act of putting together the various account statements, which did show trading activity, has to involve a number of people. You would need office and support personnel, people who actually knew what the market prices were for the securities that were being traded. You would need accountants so that the internal documents reconcile with the documents being sent to customers at least on a superficial basis,"" said Tom Dewey, a securities lawyer.
Arvenlund wrote there was widespread suspicion of confederates to the fraud within Madoff's inner circle, but the secretive nature of the scheme made investigation difficult.


=== Alleged co-conspirators ===
Jeffry Picower and his wife, Barbara, of Palm Beach, Florida, and Manhattan, had two dozen accounts. He was a lawyer, accountant, and investor who led buyouts of health-care and technology companies. Picower's foundation stated its investment portfolio with Madoff was valued at nearly $1 billion at one time. In June 2009, Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff's assets, filed a lawsuit against Picower in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan), seeking the return of $7.2 billion in profits, alleging that Picower and his wife Barbara knew or should have known that their rates of return were ""implausibly high"", with some accounts showing annual returns ranging from 120% to more than 550% from 1996 through 1998, and 950% in 1999. On October 25, 2009, Picower, 67, was found dead of a massive heart attack at the bottom of his Palm Beach swimming pool. On December 17, 2010, it was announced that a settlement of $7.2 billion had been reached between Irving Picard and Barbara Picower, Picower's widow, the executor of the Picower estate to resolve the Madoff trustee suit, and repay losses in the Madoff fraud. It was the largest single forfeiture in American judicial history. ""Barbara Picower has done the right thing,"" US Attorney Preet Bharara said.
Stanley Chais, of the Brighton Company: On May 1, 2009, Picard filed a lawsuit against Stanley Chais. The complaint alleged he ""knew or should have known"" he was involved in a Ponzi scheme when his family investments with Madoff averaged a 40% return. It also claimed Chais was a primary beneficiary of the scheme for at least 30 years, allowing his family to withdraw more than $1 billion from their accounts since 1995. The SEC filed a similar civil suit mirroring these claims. On September 22, 2009, Chais was sued by California Attorney General Jerry Brown who was seeking $25 million in penalties as well as restitution for victims, saying the Beverly Hills investment manager was a 'middleman' in Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Chais died in September 2010. The widow, children, family, and estate of Chais settled with Picard in 2016 for $277 million. Picard's lawyers said the settlement covered all of Chais' estate, and substantially all of his widow's assets.
Fairfield Greenwich Group, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, had a ""Fairfield Sentry"" fund—one of many feeder funds that gave investors portals to Madoff. On April 1, 2009, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed a civil action charging Fairfield Greenwich with fraud and breaching its fiduciary duty to clients by failing to provide promised due diligence on its investments. The complaint sought a fine and restitution to Massachusetts investors for losses and disgorgement of performance fees paid to Fairfield by those investors. It alleged that, in 2005, Madoff coached Fairfield staff about ways to answer questions from SEC attorneys who were looking into Markopolos' complaint about Madoff's operations. The fund settled with the Commonwealth in September 2009 for $8 million. On May 18, 2009, the hedge fund was sued by trustee Irving Picard, seeking a return of $3.2 billion during the period from 2002 to Madoff's arrest in December 2008. However, the money may already be in the hands of Fairfield's own clients, who are likely off-limits to Picard, since they weren't direct investors with Madoff. In May 2011 the liquidator for the funds settled with Picard for $1 billion.
Peter Madoff, chief compliance officer, worked with his brother Bernie for more than 40 years, and ran the daily operations for 20 years. He helped create the computerized trading system. He agreed to pay more than $90 million that he does not have to settle claims that he participated in the Ponzi scheme, but Irving Picard agreed to forbear from seeking to enforce the consent judgment as long as Peter Madoff ""makes reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Trustee in the Trustee's efforts to recover funds for the BLMIS Estate, including providing truthful information to the Trustee upon request."" He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Ruth Madoff, Bernard's wife, agreed as part of his sentencing to keep from the federal government only $2.5 million of her claim of more than $80 million in assets, and to give up all of her possessions. The $2.5 million was not however protected from civil legal actions against her pursued by a court-appointed trustee liquidating Madoff's assets, or from investor lawsuits. On July 29, 2009, she was sued by trustee Irving Picard who sought to recover from her $45 million in Madoff funds that were being used to support her ""life of splendor"" on the gains from the fraud committed by her husband. On November 25, 2008, she had withdrawn $5.5 million, and $10 million on December 10, 2008, from her brokerage account at Cohmad, a feeder fund that had an office in Madoff's headquarters and was part-owned by him. In November she also received $2 million from her husband's London office. She has been seen riding the N.Y.C. subway, and did not attend her husband's sentencing. In May 2019, 77-year-old Ruth Madoff agreed to pay $594,000 ($250,000 in cash, and $344,000 of trusts for two of her grandchildren), and to surrender her remaining assets when she dies, to settle claims by Irving Picard. She is required to provide reports to Picard about her expenditures often, as to any purchase over $100, to ensure she does not have any hidden bank accounts. The case is Picard v. Madoff, 1:09-ap-1391, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
Madoff's sons, Mark and Andrew Madoff, worked in the legitimate trading arm in the New York office, but also raised money marketing the Madoff funds. Their assets were frozen on March 31, 2009. The two became estranged from their father and mother in the wake of the fraud, which some contended was a charade to protect their assets from litigation. On October 2, 2009, a civil lawsuit was filed against them by trustee Irving Picard for a judgment in the aggregate amount of at least $198,743,299. Peter Madoff and daughter Shana were also defendants. On December 11, 2010, the second anniversary of Madoff's arrest, Mark Madoff was found having committed suicide and hanging from a ceiling pipe in the living room of his SoHo loft apartment. Andrew Madoff died September 3, 2014, from cancer. He was 48, and had reconciled with his mother prior to his death. Told that his father wanted to speak with him and explain what he had done, Andrew told Matt Lauer of the Today Show he wasn't interested. In June 2017 Irving Picard settled with the sons' estates for more than $23 million, stripping the estates of Andrew and Mark Madoff of ""all assets, cash, and other proceeds"" of their father's fraud, leaving them with a respective $2 million and $1.75 million.
Tremont Group Holdings started its first Madoff-only fund in 1997. That group managed several funds marketed under the Re Select Broad Market Fund. In July 2011, Tremont Group Holdings settled with Irving Picard for more than $1 billion.
The Maxam Fund invested through Tremont. Sandra L. Manzke, founder of Maxam Capital, had her assets temporarily frozen by the same Connecticut court. In August 2013, Irving Picard reached a $98 million settlement with Maxam Absolute Return Fund.
Cohmad Securities Corp., of which Madoff owned a 10–20% stake: The brokerage firm listed its address as Madoff's firm's address in New York City. Its chairman, Maurice J. ""Sonny"" Cohn, his daughter and COO Marcia Beth Cohn, and Robert M. Jaffe, a broker at the firm, were accused by the SEC of four counts of civil fraud, ""knowingly or recklessly disregarding facts indicating that Madoff was operating a fraud,"" and they settled that suit with the SEC in 2010. Another lawsuit filed by bankruptcy trustee Irving Picard sought funds for Madoff victims. In November 2016, Picard announced that the estate of ""Sonny"" Cohn, his widow Marilyn Cohn, and their daughter had agreed to settle with Picard for $32.1 million.
Madoff Securities International Ltd. in London; individual and entities related to it were sued by Irving Picard and Stephen J. Akers, a joint liquidator of Madoff's London operation, in the United Kingdom's High Court of Justice Commercial Court.
J. Ezra Merkin, a prominent investment advisor and philanthropist, was sued for his role in running a ""feeder fund"" for Madoff. On April 6, 2009, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo filed civil fraud charges against Merkin alleging he ""betrayed hundreds of investors"" by moving $2.4 billion of clients' money to Madoff without their knowledge. The complaint stated he lied about putting the money with Madoff, failed to disclose conflicts of interest, and collected over $470 million in fees for his three hedge funds, Ascot Partners LP with Ascot Fund Ltd., Gabriel Capital Corp., and Ariel Fund Ltd. He promised he would actively manage the money, but instead, he misguided investors about his Madoff investments in quarterly reports, in investor presentations, and in conversations with investors. ""Merkin held himself out to investors as an investing guru... In reality, Merkin was but a master marketer.""
Carl J. Shapiro, women's clothing entrepreneur, self-made millionaire, and philanthropist, and one of Madoff's oldest friends and biggest financial backers, who helped him start his investment firm in 1960. He was never in the finance business. In 1971, Shapiro sold his business, Kay Windsor, Inc., for $20 million. Investing most of it with Madoff, that sum grew to hundreds of millions of dollars and possibly to more than $1 billion. Shapiro personally lost about $400 million, $250 million of which he gave to Madoff 10 days before Madoff's arrest. His foundation lost more than $100 million.
The Hadon Organisation, a UK-based company involved in mergers and acquisitions: Between 2001 and 2008 The Hadon Organisation established very close ties with Madoff Securities International Ltd. in London.
David G. Friehling, the sole practitioner at Friehling & Horowitz CPAs, waived indictment and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges on July 10, 2009. He agreed to proceed without having the evidence in the criminal case against him reviewed by a grand jury at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan. Friehling was charged on March 18, 2009, with securities fraud, aiding and abetting investment adviser fraud, and four counts of filing false audit reports with the SEC. On November 3, 2009, Friehling pled guilty to the charges. His involvement in the scheme made it the largest accounting fraud in history, dwarfing the $11 billion accounting fraud masterminded by Bernard Ebbers at WorldCom. In May 2015, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain sentenced Friehling to one year of home detention and one year of supervised release, with Friehling avoiding prison because he cooperated extensively with federal prosecutors and because he had been unaware of the extent of Madoff's crimes. Swain suggested that Friehling be forced to pay part of the overall $130 million forfeiture arising from the fraud.
Frank DiPascali, who referred to himself as ""director of options trading"" and as ""chief financial officer"" at Madoff Securities, pled guilty on August 11, 2009, to 10 counts: conspiracy, securities fraud, investment advisor fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, perjury, income tax evasion, international money laundering, falsifying books and records of a broker-dealer and investment advisor. He agreed to ""connect the dots"" and to ""name names"", with sentencing originally scheduled for May 2010. Prosecutors sought more than $170 billion in forfeiture, the same amount sought from Madoff, which represents funds deposited by investors and later disbursed to other investors. The same day, an SEC civil complaint was filed against DiPascali. On May 7, 2015, while still awaiting sentencing, DiPascali died of lung cancer.
Daniel Bonventre, former operations director for Bernard Madoff Investment Securities. He was convicted on 21 counts, and sentenced to 10 years in jail.
Joann Crupi (Westfield, NJ; sentenced to six years in prison) and Annette Bongiorno (Boca Raton, FL; sentenced to six years in prison), both back office employees, were arrested in November 2010. ""Authorities previously said Bongiorno was a staff supervisor and was responsible for answering questions from Madoff's clients about their purported investments. They allege she oversaw the fabrication of documents"", according to the Associated Press.
Jerome O'Hara (sentenced to two and a half years in prison) and George Perez (sentenced to two and a half years in prison), long-time employees of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BLMIS), were charged in an indictment in November 2010, and in a 33-count superseding indictment on October 1, 2012.
Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz, controller of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, but not a licensed certified public accountant: Her signature is on checks from BLMIS to Cohmad Securities Corp. representing commission payments. She was the liaison between the SEC and BLMIS regarding the firm's financial statements. The SEC has removed the statements from its website. She pled guilty to her role.


== Charges and sentencing ==
The criminal case is U.S.A. v. Madoff, 1:08-mJ-02735.
The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Madoff, 1:08-cv- 10791, both U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. The cases against Fairfield Greenwich Group et al. were consolidated as 09-118 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
While awaiting sentencing, Madoff met with the SEC's Inspector General, H. David Kotz, who was conducting an investigation into how regulators failed to detect the fraud despite numerous red flags. Because of concerns of improper conduct by Inspector General Kotz in conducting the Madoff investigation, Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent outside review of Kotz's actions. The Williams Report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, because Kotz was a ""very good friend"" with Markopolos. Investigators were not able to determine when Kotz and Markopolos became friends. A violation of the ethics rules took place if their friendship was concurrent with Kotz's investigation of Madoff.
Former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt estimated the actual net fraud to be between $10 and $17 billion, because it does not include the fictional returns credited to the Madoff's customer accounts.


=== Criminal complaint ===
U.S. v. Madoff, 08-MAG-02735.
The original criminal complaint estimated that investors lost $50 billion through the scheme, though The Wall Street Journal reports ""that figure includes the alleged false profits that Mr. Madoff's firm reported to its customers for decades. It is unclear exactly how much investors deposited into the firm."" He was originally charged with a single count of securities fraud and faced up to 20 years in prison, and a fine of $5 million if convicted.
Court papers indicate that Madoff's firm had about 4,800 investment client accounts as of November 30, 2008, and issued statements for that month reporting that client accounts held a total balance of about $65 billion, but actually ""held only a small fraction"" of that balance for clients.
Madoff was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on December 11, 2008, on a criminal charge of securities fraud. According to the criminal complaint, the previous day he had told his sons that his business was ""a giant Ponzi scheme"". They called a friend for advice, Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer, who called federal prosecutors and the SEC on their behalf. FBI Agent Theodore Cacioppi made a house call. ""We are here to find out if there is an innocent explanation,"" Cacioppi said quietly. The 70-year-old financier paused, then said: ""There is no innocent explanation."" He had ""paid investors with money that was not there"". Madoff was released on the same day of his arrest after posting $10 million bail. Madoff and his wife surrendered their passports, and he was subject to travel restrictions, a 7 p.m. curfew at his co-op, and electronic monitoring as a condition of bail. Although Madoff only had two co-signers for his $10 million bail, his wife and his brother Peter, rather than the four required, a judge allowed him free on bail but ordered him confined to his apartment. Madoff reportedly received death threats that were referred to the FBI, and the SEC referred to fears of ""harm or flight"" in its request for Madoff to be confined to his Upper East Side apartment. Cameras monitored his apartment's doors, its communication devices sent signals to the FBI, and his wife was required to pay for additional security.
Apart from 'Bernard L. Madoff' and 'Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (""BMIS"")', the order to freeze all activities also forbade trading from the companies Madoff Securities International Ltd. (""Madoff International"") and Madoff Ltd.
On January 5, 2009, prosecutors requested that the Court revoke his bail, after Madoff and his wife allegedly violated the court-ordered asset freeze by mailing jewelry worth up to $1 million to relatives, including their sons and Madoff's brother. It was also noted that $173 million in signed checks had been found in Madoff's office desk after he had been arrested. His sons reported the mailings to prosecutors. Up to that point, Madoff was thought to be cooperating with prosecutors. The following week, Judge Ellis refused the government's request to revoke Madoff's bail, but required as a condition of bail that Madoff make an inventory of personal items and that his mail be searched.
On March 10, 2009, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed an 11-count criminal information charging Madoff with 11 federal crimes: securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, false statements, perjury, making false filings with the SEC, and theft from an employee benefit plan. The complaint stated that Madoff had defrauded his clients of almost $65 billion – thus spelling out the largest Ponzi scheme in history, as well as the largest investor fraud committed by a single person.
Madoff pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering. Prosecutors alleged that he used the London Office, Madoff Securities International Ltd. to launder more than $250 million of client money by transferring client money from the investment-advisory business in New York to London, and then back to the U.S., to support the U.S. trading operation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Madoff gave the appearance that he was trading in Europe for his clients.


=== Plea proceeding ===
On March 12, 2009, Madoff appeared in court in a plea proceeding, and pleaded guilty to all charges. There was no plea agreement between the government and Madoff; he simply pleaded guilty and signed a waiver of indictment. The charges carried a maximum sentence of 150 years in prison, as well as mandatory restitution and fines up to twice the gross gain or loss derived from the offenses. If the government's estimate were correct, Madoff would have to pay $7.2 billion in restitution. A month earlier, Madoff settled the SEC's civil suit against him. He accepted a lifetime ban from the securities industry, and also agreed to pay an undisclosed fine.

In his pleading allocution, Madoff admitted to running a Ponzi scheme and expressed regret for his ""criminal acts"". He stated that he had begun his scheme some time in the early 1990s. He wished to satisfy his clients' expectations of high returns he had promised, even though it was during an economic recession. He admitted that he hadn't invested any of his clients' money since the inception of his scheme. Instead, he merely deposited the money into his business account at Chase Manhattan Bank. He admitted to false trading activities masked by foreign transfers and false SEC returns. When clients requested account withdrawals, he paid them from the Chase account, claiming the profits were the result of his own unique ""split-strike conversion strategy"". He said he had every intention of terminating the scheme, but it proved ""difficult, and ultimately impossible"" to extricate himself. He eventually reconciled himself to being exposed as a fraud.
Only two of at least 25 victims who had requested to be heard at the hearing spoke in open court against accepting Madoff's plea of guilt.
Judge Denny Chin accepted his guilty plea and remanded him to incarceration at the Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center until sentencing. Chin said that Madoff was now a substantial flight risk given his age, wealth, and the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.
Madoff's attorney, Ira Sorkin, filed an appeal, to return him back to his ""penthouse arrest"", await sentencing, and to reinstate his bail conditions, declaring he would be more amenable to cooperate with the government's investigation, and prosecutors filed a notice in opposition. On March 20, 2009, the appellate court denied his request.
On June 26, 2009, Chin ordered Madoff to forfeit $170 million in assets. His wife Ruth was to relinquish her claim to $80 million worth of assets, leaving her with $2.5 million in cash. The settlement did not prevent the SEC and Irving Picard from continuing to make claims against Ruth Madoff's funds in the future. Madoff had earlier requested to shield $70 million in assets for Ruth, arguing that it was unconnected to the fraud scheme.


=== Sentencing, prison life and death ===
Prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of 150 years, the maximum possible under federal sentencing guidelines. They informed Chin that Irving Picard, the trustee overseeing bankruptcy proceedings for the Madoff organization, had indicated that ""Mr. Madoff has not provided meaningful cooperation or assistance."" The Bureau of US Prisons had recommended 50 years, while defense lawyer Ira Sorkin had recommended 12 years, arguing that Madoff had confessed. The judge granted Madoff permission to wear his personal clothing at sentencing.
On June 29, Judge Chin sentenced Madoff to 150 years in prison, as recommended by the prosecution. Chin said he had not received any mitigating letters from friends or family testifying to Madoff's good deeds, saying that ""the absence of such support is telling."" Commentators noted that this was in contrast to other high-profile white collar trials such as those of Andrew Fastow, Jeffrey Skilling, and Bernard Ebbers who were known for their philanthropy and/or cooperation to help victims; however, Madoff's victims included several charities and foundations, and the only person who pleaded for mercy was his defense lawyer Ira Sorkin.
Chin called the fraud ""unprecedented"" and ""staggering"", and stated that the sentence would deter others from committing similar frauds. He stated, ""Here the message must be sent that Mr. Madoff's crimes were extraordinarily evil."" Many victims, some of whom had lost their life savings, applauded the sentence. Chin agreed with prosecutors' contention that the fraud began at some point in the 1980s. He also noted Madoff's crimes were ""off the charts"" since federal sentencing guidelines for fraud only go up to $400 million in losses; Madoff swindled his investors out of several times that. Prosecutors estimated that, at the very least, Madoff was responsible for a loss of $13 billion, more than 32 times the federal cap; the commonly quoted loss of $65 billion is more than 162 times the cap.
Chin said ""I have a sense Mr. Madoff has not done all that he could do or told all that he knows,"" noting that Madoff failed to identify accomplices, making it more difficult for prosecutors to build cases against others. Chin dismissed Sorkin's plea for leniency, stating that Madoff made substantial loans to family members and moved $15 million from the firm to his wife's account shortly before confessing. Picard also said that Madoff's failure to provide substantial assistance complicated efforts to locate assets. A former federal prosecutor suggested Madoff would have had the possibility of a sentence with parole if he fully cooperated with investigators, but Madoff's silence implied that there were other accomplices in the fraud, which led the judge to impose the maximum sentence. Chin also ordered Madoff to pay $170 billion in restitution.
Madoff apologized to his victims at the sentencing, saying, ""I have left a legacy of shame, as some of my victims have pointed out, to my family and my grandchildren. This is something I will live in for the rest of my life. I'm sorry.... I know that doesn't help you.""
Madoff was incarcerated at Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside Raleigh, North Carolina. His inmate number was #61727-054.
On July 28, 2009, he gave his first jailhouse interview to Joseph Cotchett and Nancy Fineman, attorneys from San Francisco, because they threatened to sue his wife, Ruth, on behalf of several investors who lost fortunes. During the 41⁄2 hour session, he ""answered every one of [the attorneys'] questions"", and expressed remorse, according to Cotchett.
Madoff died of natural causes in a federal prison hospital in 2021.


== Recovery of funds ==

Madoff's combined assets were worth about $826 million at the time that they were frozen. Madoff provided a confidential list of his and his firm's assets to the SEC on December 31, 2008, which was disclosed on March 13, 2009, in a court filing. Madoff had no IRAs, no 401(k), no Keogh plan, no other pension plan, and no annuities. He owned less than a combined $200,000 in securities in Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Bear Stearns, and M&T. No offshore or Swiss bank accounts were listed.

On March 17, 2009, a prosecutor filed a document listing more assets, including $2.6 million in jewelry and about 35 sets of watches and cufflinks, more than $30 million in loans owed to the couple by their sons, and Ruth Madoff's interest in real estate funds sponsored by Sterling Equities, whose partners included Fred Wilpon. Ruth Madoff and Peter Madoff invested as ""passive limited partners"" in real estate funds sponsored by the company, as well as other venture investments. Assets also included the Madoffs' interest in Hoboken Radiology LLC in Hoboken, New Jersey; Delivery Concepts LLC, an online food ordering service in midtown Manhattan that operated as ""delivery.com""; an interest in Madoff La Brea LLC; an interest in the restaurant, PJ Clarke's on the Hudson LLC; and Boca Raton, Florida-based Viager II LLC.
On March 2, 2009, Judge Louis Stanton modified an existing freeze order to surrender assets Madoff owned: his securities firm, real estate, artwork, and entertainment tickets, and granted a request by prosecutors that the existing freeze remain in place for the Manhattan apartment, and vacation homes in Montauk, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. He also agreed to surrender his interest in Primex Holdings LLC, a joint venture between Madoff Securities and several large brokerages, designed to replicate the auction process on the New York Stock Exchange. Madoff's April 14, 2009, opening day New York Mets tickets were sold for $7,500 on eBay.
On April 13, 2009, a Connecticut judge dissolved the temporary asset freeze from March 30, 2009, and issued an order for Fairfield Greenwich Group executive Walter Noel to post property pledges of $10 million against his Greenwich home and $2 million against Jeffrey Tucker's. Noel agreed to the attachment on his house ""with no findings, including no finding of liability or wrongdoing"". Andres Piedrahita's assets continued to remain temporarily frozen because he was never served with the complaint. The principals were all involved in a lawsuit filed by the town of Fairfield, Connecticut, pension funds, which lost $42 million. The pension fund case was Retirement Program for Employees of the Town of Fairfield v. Madoff, FBT-CV-09-5023735-S, Superior Court of Connecticut (Bridgeport). Maxam Capital and other firms that allegedly fed Madoff's fund, which could allow Fairfield to recover up to $75 million, were also part of the dissolution and terms.
Professor John Coffee, of Columbia University Law School, said that much of Madoff's money may be in offshore funds. The SEC believed keeping the assets secret would prevent them from being seized by foreign regulators and foreign creditors.
The Montreal Gazette reported on January 12, 2010, that there were unrecovered Madoff assets in Canada.
In December 2010, the widow Barbara Picower and others reached an agreement with Irving Picard to return $7.2 billion from the estate of her deceased husband Jeffrey Picower to other investors in the fraud. It was the largest single forfeiture in American judicial history.
In connection with the victim compensation process, on December 14 and 17, 2012, the Government filed motions requesting that the Court find restitution to be impracticable, thereby permitting the Government to distribute to victims the more than $2.35 billion forfeited to date as part of its investigation through the remission process, in accordance with Department of Justice regulations. Richard C. Breeden was retained to serve as Special Master on behalf of the Department of Justice to administer the process of compensating the victims through the Madoff Victim Fund.
The Madoff Recovery Initiative reports $14.377 billion in recoveries and settlement agreements as of December 18, 2020.


== Affected clients ==

On February 4, 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan released a 162-page client list with at least 13,500 different accounts, but without listing the amounts invested. Individual investors who invested through Fairfield Greenwich Group, Ascot Partners, and Chais Investments were not included on the list.
Clients included banks, hedge funds, charities, universities, and wealthy individuals who had disclosed about $41 billion invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, according to a Bloomberg News tally, which may have included double counting of investors in feeder funds.
Although Madoff filed a report with the SEC in 2008 stating that his advisory business had only 11–25 clients and about $17.1 billion in assets, thousands of investors reported losses, and Madoff estimated the fund's assets at $50 billion.
Other notable clients included former Salomon Brothers economist Henry Kaufman, Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, screenwriter Eric Roth, actors Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, John Malkovich, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Rue McClanahan, politician Frank Lautenberg, Mortimer Zuckerman, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax, the Wilpon family (owners of the New York Mets), broadcaster Larry King and World Trade Center developer Larry Silverstein. The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity lost $15.2 million, and Wiesel and his wife, Marion, lost their life savings.


=== Largest stake-holders ===
According to The Wall Street Journal the investors with the largest potential losses, including feeder funds, were:

The potential losses of these eight investors total $21.32 billion.
The feeder fund Thema International Fund as of November 30, 2008, had a then-purported net asset value invested in the fund of $1.1 billion.
Eleven investors had potential losses between $100 million and $1 billion:

The fund Defender Limited has a $523 million claim in the BLMIS liquidation.
Twenty-three investors with potential losses of $500,000 to $100 million were also listed, with a total potential loss of $540 million. The grand total potential loss in The Wall Street Journal table was $26.9 billion.
Some investors amended their initial estimates of losses to include only their original investment, since the profits Madoff reported were most likely fraudulent. Yeshiva University, for instance, said its actual incurred loss was its invested $14.5 million, not the $110 million initially estimated, which included falsified profits reported to the university by Madoff.


==== IRS penalties ====
It was estimated the potential tax penalties for foundations invested with Madoff were $1 billion.
Although foundations are exempt from federal income taxes, they are subject to an excise tax, for failing to vet Madoff's proposed investments properly, to heed red flags, or to diversify prudently. Penalties may range from 10% of the amount invested during a tax year, to 25% if they fail to try to recover the funds. The foundation's officers, directors, and trustees faced up to a 15% penalty, with up to $20,000 fines for individual managers, per investment.


== Impact and aftermath ==


=== Criminal charges against Aurelia Finance ===
Criminal charges against five directors proceeded against Swiss wealth manager Aurelia Finance, which lost an alleged $800 million of client money. The directors' assets were frozen. In September 2015 they paid ""substantial compensation"" to settle the criminal complaints.


=== Grupo Santander ===
Clients primarily located in South America who invested with Madoff through the Spanish bank Grupo Santander, filed a class action against Santander in Miami. Santander proposed a settlement that would give the clients $2 billion worth of preferred stock in Santander based on each client's original investment. The shares pay a 2% dividend. Seventy percent of the Madoff/Santander investors accepted the offer.


=== Union Bancaire Privee ===
On May 8, 2009, a lawsuit against UBP was filed on behalf of New York investor Andrea Barron in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Despite being a victim of Bernard Madoff's fraud, the bank offered in March 2009 to compensate eligible investors 50 percent of the money they initially invested with Madoff. In March 2010, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York threw out the class action against Union Bancaire Privée that had been brought under state law, holding that private securities class actions alleging misrepresentations or omissions must be brought under the federal securities laws.
On December 6, 2010, Union Bancaire Privée announced it had reached a settlement with Irving Picard, the trustee for Madoff Investment Securities. UBP agreed to pay as much as $500 million to resolve the trustee's claims. UBP was the first bank to settle the Madoff trustee's claim. With the settlement, the trustee agreed to discharge his ""clawback"" claims against UBP, its affiliates, and clients.


=== Bank Medici ===
Bank Medici is an Austrian bank founded by Sonja Kohn, who met Madoff in 1985 while living in New York. Ninety percent of the bank's income was generated from Madoff investments.
In 1992 Kohn introduced Madoff to Mario Benbassat, founder of Genevalor Benbassat & Cie, and his two sons in New York, as a possible source of new funds for Madoff. Genevalor set up five European feeder funds, including $1.1bn Irish fund Thema International Fund set up by Thema Asset Management, a British Virgin Islands-based company 55 per cent owned by Genevalor, and invested almost $2 billion with Madoff. Thema International paid fees of 1.25 per cent ($13.75m a year) to Genevalor Benbasset & Cie.
 The Wall Street Journal reported in December 2008 that the company was said to be a key player distributing Madoff investments in the Madoff investment scandal.
In December 2008, Medici reported that two of its funds—Herald USA Fund and Herald Luxemburg Fund—were exposed to Madoff losses. On January 2, 2009, FMA, the Austria banking regulator, took control of Bank Medici and appointed a supervisor to control the bank. Bank Medici was sued by its customers both in the U.S. and in Austria. The Vienna State Prosecutor launched a criminal investigation of Bank Medici and Kohn, who had invested an estimated $2.1 billion with Madoff. On May 28, 2009, Bank Medici lost its Austrian banking license. Kohn and the bank were under investigation, but she was not accused of criminal wrongdoing.


=== The Innocence Project ===
The Innocence Project was partly funded by the JEHT Foundation, a private charity backed by a wealthy couple, Ken and Jeanne Levy-Church, financed with Madoff's mythical money. Jeanne Levy-Church's losses forced her to shut down both her foundation and that of her parents, the Betty and Norman F. Levy Foundation, which lost $244 million. JEH helped the less fortunate, especially ex-convicts. (See  Participants in the Madoff investment scandal: Norman F. Levy.)


=== Westport National Bank ===
In April 2010, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal sued the Westport National Bank and Robert L. Silverman for ""effectively aiding and abetting"" Madoff's fraud. The suit sought recovery of $16.2 million, including the fees that the bank collected as custodian of customers' holding in Madoff investments. Silverman's 240 clients invested about $10 million with Madoff using the bank as the custodian. The bank denied any wrongdoing.


=== Thema International Fund ===
In September 2017 in a case before the Irish High Court, Thema International Fund agreed to pay $687 million to resolve a trustee lawsuit brought on behalf of the fraud victims resulting from Madoff's frauds.


=== The Picower Foundation ===
The Picower Foundation, created in 2002, was one of the nation's leading philanthropies that supported groups such as the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Human Rights First, the New York Public Library and the Children's Health Fund. It was listed as the 71st-largest in the nation by the Council on Foundations. The foundation reportedly invested $1 billion with Madoff. Jeffry Picower was a friend of Bernard Madoff for 30 years. The Picower Foundation, along with other smaller charities that invested with Madoff, announced in December 2008 that they would be closing.


=== Peter Madoff ===
In June 2012, Madoff's brother Peter was ""expected to appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan and admit to, among other things, falsifying records, making false statements to securities regulators and obstructing the work of the Internal Revenue Service."" In December 2012 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his involvement in the Ponzi scheme.


=== Suicides ===


==== René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet ====
On December 23, 2008, one of the founders of Access International Advisors LLC, René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, was found dead in his company office on Madison Avenue in New York City. His left wrist was slit, and de la Villehuchet had taken sleeping pills, in what appeared to be a suicide.
He lived in New Rochelle, New York and came from a prominent French family. Although no suicide note was found at the scene, his brother Bertrand in France received a note shortly after his death in which René-Thierry expressed remorse and a feeling of responsibility for the loss of his investors' money. The FBI and SEC did not believe de la Villehuchet was involved in the fraud. Harry Markopolos said he had met with de La Villehuchet several years before, and had warned him that Madoff might be breaking the law. In 2002, Access invested about 45% of its $1.2 billion under management with Madoff. By 2008, Access managed $3 billion and raised its proportion of funds invested with Madoff to about 75%. De la Villehuchet had also invested all of his wealth and 20% of that of his brother, Bertrand, with Madoff. Bertrand said that René-Thierry did not know Madoff, but the connection was through René-Thierry's partner in AIA, French banker Patrick Littaye.


==== William Foxton ====
On February 10, 2009, highly decorated British soldier William Foxton, OBE, 65, shot himself in a park in Southampton, England, having lost all of his family's savings. He had invested in the Herald USA Fund and Herald Luxembourg Fund, feeder funds for Madoff from Bank Medici in Austria.


==== Mark Madoff ====
Madoff's elder son, Mark Madoff, was found dead on December 11, 2010, two years to the day after he turned his father in. He was found hanged with a dog leash inside his New York apartment in an apparent suicide, but authorities said he left no suicide note.
Mark had unsuccessfully sought a Wall Street trading job after the scandal broke, and it was reported that he was distraught over the possibility of criminal charges, as federal prosecutors were making criminal tax-fraud probes. Among the many Madoff family members being sued by the court-appointed trustee Irving Picard were Mark's two young children.
In his lawsuit, Picard stated that Mark and other Madoff family members improperly earned tens of millions of dollars, through ""fictitious and backdated transactions"", and falsely documented loans to buy real estate that weren't repaid. Picard also argued that Mark was in a position to recognize the fraud of his father's firm, as Mark was a co-director of trading, was the designated head of the firm in his father's absence, and held several securities licenses—Series 7, 24 and 55 with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. However, he worked in a division of Madoff's company distinct from the one involved with Madoff's fraud, which has not been accused of any wrongdoing.


==== Sondra Wiener and husband ====
Madoff's sister, Sondra Wiener, and her husband, were found dead in their Boynton Beach home on February 17, 2022 from an apparent murder–suicide, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. The name of Wiener's husband was not revealed because his family chose to invoke a law that guarantees the right to privacy of crime victims. An earlier Facebook post by the sheriff's office, however, named a 90-year-old man named Marvin as being Wiener's husband. Authorities have not provided details of who shot whom in the apparent murder–suicide.
In 2009, Sondra's son David said that Madoff had defrauded his mother, and that it was ""very painful.""


=== U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ===
Following the exposure of the Madoff investment scandal, the SEC's inspector general conducted an internal investigation into the agency's failures to uncover the scheme despite a series of red flags and tips. In September 2009, the SEC released a 477-page report on how the SEC missed these red flags, and identified repeated opportunities for SEC examiners to find the fraud and revealed how ineffective their efforts were. In response to the recommendations in the report, eight SEC employees were disciplined; none were fired.


=== JPMorgan Chase ===
On January 7, 2014, Forbes magazine and other news outlets reported that the bank JPMorgan Chase, ""where Madoff kept the bank account at the center of his fraud"", would pay a settlement of $1.7 billion. This resolved any potential criminal case against the bank arising from the Madoff scandal. JPMorgan entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors to resolve two felony charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act. The bank admitted to failing to file a ""Suspicious Activity Report"" after red flags about Madoff were raised, which, prosecutors alleged, did not have adequate anti-money laundering compliance procedures in place.


=== Payouts ===
Bloomberg Business News reported in 2016 that investors of approximately $2.5 billion of funds had made no effort to claim their lost funds. Analysts suspected that these parties remained silent because their investments were from illegal activities such as drug dealing or tax evasion, or because they had civil liabilities in the United States and did not wish to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts.
Irving Picard and his team have been overseeing the liquidation of Bernard Madoff's firm in bankruptcy court, and by mid-2019 had recovered over $13 billion—about 76 percent of approved claims—by suing those who profited from the scheme, whether they knew of the scheme or not. Kathy Bazoian Phelps, a lawyer at Diamond McCarthy, said ""That kind of recovery is extraordinary and atypical,"" as clawbacks in such schemes range from 5 percent to 30 percent, and many victims don't get anything. Picard has successfully pursued not only investors, but also spouses and estates of those who profited, such as the wife of Bernard Madoff (Ruth Madoff), the widow and estate of the deceased Stanley Chais, and the widow and estate of the deceased Jeffry Picower, with whom he reached a $7.2 billion settlement (the largest civil forfeiture payment in US history). ""You don't take this job if you're thin-skinned,"" Picard said.
In May 2019 Ruth Madoff settled with Picard, agreeing to surrender $250,000 in cash and another $344,000 in trusts for her grandchildren.

"Slamming is the impact of the bottom structure of a ship onto the sea surface. It is mainly observed while sailing in waves, when the bow raises from the water and subsequently impacts on it. Slamming induces extremely high loads to ship structures and is taken into consideration when designing ships.  Slamming is not strictly limited to ships but is observed in watercraft as small as kayaks.
 For trimarans and catamarans, slamming can occur when an ama slams back down into the sea after being lifted clear by wind or wave action.  Slamming can also occur for multihull vessels when the sea strikes an area that is normally above water level and join the vessel's hulls together. 
Slamming can occur in relatively mild sea conditions if the vessel is prone to pitching, which is more likely to occur aboard vessels where the bow and stern sections are both narrow.

"History sniffing is a class of web vulnerabilities and attacks that allow a website to track a user's web browsing history activities by recording which websites a user has visited and which the user has not. This is done by leveraging long-standing information leakage issues inherent to the design of the web platform, one of the most well-known of which includes detecting CSS attribute changes in links that the user has already visited.
Despite being known about since 2002, history sniffing is still considered an unsolved problem. In 2010, researchers revealed that multiple high-profile websites had used history sniffing to identify and track users. Shortly afterwards, Mozilla and all other major web browsers implemented defences against history sniffing. However, recent research has shown that these mitigations are ineffective against specific variants of the attack and history sniffing can still occur via visited links and newer browser features.


== Background ==

Early browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator were built on the model of the web being a set of statically linked documents known as pages. In this model, it made sense for the user to know which documents they had previously visited and which they hadn't, regardless of which document was referring to them. Mosaic, one of the earliest graphical web browsers, used purple links to show that a page had been visited and blue links to show pages that had not been visited. This paradigm stuck around and was subsequently adopted by all modern web browsers.
Over the years, the web evolved from its original model of static content towards more dynamic content. In 1995, employees at Netscape added a scripting language, Javascript, to its flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. This addition allowed users to add interactivity to the web page via executing Javascript programs as part of the rendering process. However, this addition came with a new security problem, that of these Javascript programs being able to access each other's execution context and sensitive information about the user. As a result, shortly afterwards, Netscape Navigator introduced the same-origin policy. This security measure prevented Javascript from being able to arbitrarily access data in a different web page's execution context. However, while the same-origin policy was subsequently extended to cover a large variety of features introduced before its existence, it was never extended to cover hyperlinks since it was perceived to hurt the user's ability to browse the web. This innocuous omission would manifest into one of the well known and earliest forms of history sniffing known on the web.


== History ==

One of the first publicly disclosed reports of a history sniffing exploit was made by Andrew Clover from Purdue University in a mailing list post on BUGTRAQ in 2002. The post detailed how a malicious website could use Javascript to determine if a given link was of a specific colour, thus revealing if the link had been previously visited. While this was initially thought of to be a theoretical exploit with little real-world value, later research by Jang et al. in 2010 revealed that high-profile websites were using this technique in the wild to reveal user browsing data. As a result multiple lawsuits were filed against the websites that were found to have used history sniffing alleging a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
In the same year, L. David Baron from Mozilla Corporation developed a defence against the attack that all major browsers would later adopt. The defence included restrictions against what kinds of CSS attributes could be used to style visited links. The ability to add background images and CSS transitions to links was disallowed. Additionally, visited links would be treated identically to standard links, with Javascript application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow the website to query the color of specific elements returning the same attributes for a visited link as those for non-visited links. This ensured malicious websites could not simply infer a person's browsing history by querying the colour changes.
In 2011, research by then-Stanford graduate student Jonathan Mayer found that advertising company Epic Marketplace Inc. had used history sniffing to collect information about the browsing history of users across the web. A subsequent investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) revealed that Epic Marketplace had used history sniffing code as a part of advertisements in over 24,000 web domains, including ESPN and Papa Johns. The Javascript code allowed Epic Marketplace to track if a user has visited any of over 54,000 domains. The resulting data was subsequently used by Epic Marketplace to categorize users into specific groups and serve advertisements based on the websites the user had visited. As a result of this investigation, the FTC banned Epic Marketplace Inc. from conducting any form of online advertising and marketing for twenty years and was ordered to permanently delete the data it had collected.

The threat model of history sniffing relies on the adversary being able to direct the victim to a malicious website entirely or partially under the adversary's control. The adversary can accomplish this by compromising a previously good web page, by phishing the user to a web page allowing the adversary to load arbitrary code, or by using a malicious advertisement on an otherwise safe web page. While most history sniffing attacks do not require user interactions, specific variants of the attacks need users to interact with particular elements which can often be disguised as buttons, browser games, CAPTCHAs, and other such elements.


== Modern variants ==
Despite being partially mitigated in 2010, history sniffing is still considered an unsolved problem. In 2011, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University showed that while the defences proposed by Mozilla were sufficient to prevent most non-interactive attacks, such as those found by Jang et al., they were ineffective against interactive attacks. By showing users overlaid letters, numbers and patterns, which would only reveal themselves if a user had visited a specific website, the researchers were able to trick 307 participants into potentially revealing their browsing history via history sniffing. This was done by presenting the activities in the form of pattern solving problems, chess games and CAPTCHAs.
In 2018, researchers at the University of California, San Diego demonstrated timing attacks that could bypass the mitigations introduced by Mozilla. By abusing the CSS paint API (which allows developers to draw a background image programmatically) and targeting the bytecode cache of the browser, the researchers were able to time the amount of time it took to paint specific links. Thus, they were able to provide probabilistic techniques for identifying visited websites.
Since 2019, multiple history sniffing attacks have been found targeting various newer features browsers provide. In 2020, Sanchez-Rola et al. demonstrated that by measuring the time a server takes to respond to a request with HTTP cookies and then comparing it to how long it took for a server to respond without cookies, a website could perform history sniffing.  In 2023, Ali et al. demonstrated that newly introduced browser features could be abused also to perform history sniffing. One particularly notable example highlighted was the fact that a recently introduced feature, the Private Tokens API, introduced under Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative with an intention to prevent user tracking, could allow malicious actors to exfiltrate users browsing data by using techniques similar to those used for cross-site leak attacks.

"Contract cheating is a form of academic dishonesty in which students pay others to complete their coursework. The term was coined in a 2006 study by Thomas Lancaster and Robert Clarke as a more inclusive way to talk about all forms of academic work, as opposed to more outdated terms such as ""term paper mill"" or ""essay mill"", which refer to text-based academic outsourcing. In contrast, Lancaster and Clarke are computer scientists who found evidence of students systematically outsourcing coding assignments. Hence, they coined the term ""contract cheating"" to include all outsourced academic work, regardless of whether it is from text-based or non-text-based disciplines. 


== Extent ==
The first published material detailing the extent of contract cheating was a study by Robert Clarke and Thomas Lancaster. The study presented three main findings:

Over 12 percent of postings on a popular website for outsourcing computer contract work were actually bid requests from students seeking contract cheating services.
Contract cheaters posted an average of 4–7 requests, suggesting that some students make habitual use of such services.
A smaller number of users have posted over 50 bid requests, including examples from multiple institutions. This suggests that these are agencies subcontracting work, not students who are directly making use of the services.
A 2007 study examined more than 900 examples of contract cheating by students studying computing subjects. The published results categorised the assignment types (e.g. programming, database, web design, etc.) and were analysed by country. One new concern identified by this study was the number of major projects (both final-year undergraduate and postgraduate) that had been posted on auction sites.
Research interest in contract cheating was significantly increased in the mid-2010s as a consequence of various scandals being reported in the media. For example, in 2014, Australian media exposed the MyMaster website, which provided custom-written assignments to hundreds of students. 
In a 2017 meta-analysis of five studies, 3.5% of a total of 1,378 students reported having bought assignments to submit as their own. Of the students who reported engaging in contract cheating, more than 60% admitted to having done so more than once. A larger systematic review of 65 studies from 1978 to 2016 also found that 3.5% of students admitted to engaging in commercial contract cheating. Subsequently, a study of over 14,000 Australian students found that 5.8% of students engaged in one of five behaviours classified as contract cheating, with 2.2% submitting assessments completed by other people. However, a 2021 study argued that anonymous self-report surveys underestimate the extent of contract cheating, and using an incentivized truth-telling methods, it suggested that 7.9% of students buy and submit custom-written assignments while 11.4% submit assignments downloaded from file-sharing sites as their own.
A study was presented at the April 2012 STEM conference involving more than 600 assignments in subject areas ranging from anthropology to theology. There is debate about which subjects are most susceptible to contract cheating, but an overall consensus by several scholars, including Curtis & Clare (2017), Bretag (2017), Lancaster & Clarke (2015) and Eaton (2019), indicates that the following disciplines have the highest incidence:

Business
Engineering
Sciences (including pre-medicine and health sciences)
Humanities
Education
The commercial aspects of contract cheating were examined in a paper given at the 2013 Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education. This paper analysed the monetary value of contract cheating to the various parties who play roles in the contract cheating process. The main analysis was based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat, collected between March 2005 and July 2012.
Other prominent academic integrity scholars and experts include Tracey Bretag (Australia), Cath Ellis (Australia), and Sarah Elaine Eaton (Canada) and Irene Glendinning (UK).
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in contract cheating were identified as being particularly problematic. Test and exam based assessments, which are typically conducted in invigilated halls, took place online as a social distancing measure; without the rigorous monitoring that is typically present in such assignments, opportunities for contract cheating over the Internet arose.


== Prevention ==
Assessment design strategies may help to prevent contract cheating from occurring. 
For example, individualized assessments have been shown to be effective against contract cheating.
In addition, some institutions have taken pro-active measures to block access to contract cheating companies websites from campus users. Since August 2022, Australia started blocking access to contract cheating sites nationally.


== Detection ==
In July 2007, Lancaster and Clarke proposed a systematic six-stage process that tutors can use to detect students who are contract cheating. Since then, additional research has been conducted with evidence now pointing to training for those who grade academic work being an important aspect of detection.
The quality of solutions to assignments sold by essay mills has been questioned, though other research claims that academic work obtained through the use of an auction site was of sufficient quality to gain satisfactory grades and thus remain undetected by educators. Contract cheating sites often boast that the use of their services is undetectable, however such claims have been refuted by empirical research that shows educators can be effectively trained to detect contract cheating in student work. There are now various resources available to educators to help train them on how to effectively identify contract cheating. 
It has been proposed that existing assignment and invigilated assessment data can be systematically analyzed in order to detect patterns of students' performance that may be indicative of contract cheating. At the 2015 Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond conference, it was demonstrated how collecting analytical data at the time of writing can help in identifying cases of contract cheating.
Although text-matching software is unlikely to detect contract cheating, such tools have shown some success in identifying the source of assignments found on auction sites.


== Policy and penalties ==
The way higher education institutions across the world address contract cheating is inconsistent. The UK and Australia have developed some of the world's most systematic approaches to addressing contract cheating through policies, quality assurance guidance, and corresponding penalties for students. Meanwhile, research and advocacy are underway in countries such as Canada, to promote better understanding of how universities and colleges can address the issue through policy measures.
Some academic institutions consider contract cheating to be among the most serious forms of academic misconduct and penalise culpable students accordingly. In 2010, the Academic Misconduct Benchmarking Research Project (AMBeR) developed a plagiarism tariff in the UK in an attempt to standardise penalties for all forms of academic misconduct. The final report noted that purchase of an assignment should be penalised with the most serious measures available, such as expulsion from the institution, and that many institutions consider contract cheating as a separate form of misconduct altogether because of the seemingly obvious intent associated with it. However, a 2015 UK research study that collected university students' opinions on appropriate penalties for academic misconduct demonstrated that students consistently recommended lenient penalties for plagiarism, and that this effect was most pronounced for contract cheating.


== Legality ==
The legal status of these services varies internationally. In 2020, it became illegal for third parties to provide academic work to students in Australia. In New Zealand it is illegal to ""advertise or provide third party assistance to cheat"". 
In the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency published a report advocating the use of a legal approach as one way to tackle contract cheating, and suggested that existing fraud laws might be used, since the activities of such services, and their clients, could be reasonably interpreted to fit with definitions of fraud, as they involve false representation and failure to disclose information. A subsequent research project compared the UK fraud laws with the terms and conditions used by contract cheating services and concluded that such services would be unlikely to fall foul of fraud law because the disclaimers, terms and conditions the services provide generally state that any custom written products are to be used only as ""study guides"" or ""revision aids"", thereby placing responsibility and intent on the student client. In 2022, the Skills and Post-16 Education Act criminalised the provision of academic cheating services in England and Wales to students submitting work to English institutions—the unusual scope of this law relating to the devolved nature of the education competence in the United Kingdom. Ireland and Austria have also passed similar prohibitions. 
Despite this, media stings have shown that companies can be complicit in the inappropriate use of these products. A similar analysis in Lithuania concluded that contract cheating services were unlikely to fall foul of existing laws, although an analysis of Australian law concluded that fraud, as well as forgery and conspiracy, might be legal avenues via which contract cheating could be targeted. All three studies called for the introduction of new legal approaches to tackle contract cheating. Contract cheating is not illegal in Canada.
A follow-up research study proposed new laws, based on the principle of strict liability, to lessen the requirement for prosecutors to demonstrate that contract cheaters intended to help students cheat, instead holding contract cheaters liable for prosecution simply for offering services that could be reasonably interpreted as being used for contract cheating. Scholars have noted that such laws have created a situation where generative AI and large language model providers may be caught within the scope of these criminal offences, particularly in England and Wales and in Australia.
More broadly, despite the apparent potential of a legal challenge to contract cheating companies, prosecutions are currently rare, largely because of the limitations of existing laws. In addition, the simple act of outlawing a service would not necessarily reduce demand for it; the aforementioned research studies all call for a holistic, multi-pronged approach to tackling contract cheating.

"A Ponzi scheme (, Italian: [ˈpontsi]) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. Named after Italian confidence artist Charles Ponzi, this type of scheme misleads investors by either falsely suggesting that profits are derived from legitimate business activities (whereas the business activities are non-existent), or by exaggerating the extent and profitability of the legitimate business activities, leveraging new investments to fabricate or supplement these profits. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as investors continue to contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment or lose faith in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.
Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of the Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit"". Howe offered a solely female clientele an 8% monthly interest rate and then stole the money that the women had invested. She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison. The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens's 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.
In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in. His original scheme was purportedly based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself. Unlike earlier similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.


== Characteristics ==
In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist offers investments that promise very high returns with little or no risk to an investor. The returns are said to originate from a business or a secret idea run by the con artist. In reality, the business does not exist or the idea does not work in the way it is described or the extent of returns is made up or exaggerated. The con artist pays the high returns promised to their earlier investors by using the money obtained from later investors. Instead of engaging in a legitimate business activity, the con artist attempts to attract new investors to make the payments that were promised to earlier investors. The operator of the scheme also diverts clients' funds for the operator's personal use.
With little or no legitimate earnings, Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes collapse. As a result, most investors end up losing much or all of the money they invested. In some cases, the operator of the scheme may simply disappear with the money.


== Red flags ==
According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share characteristics that should be ""red flags"" for investors.

High investment returns with little or no risk. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns normally involve more risk. Any ""guaranteed"" investment opportunity should be considered suspect.
Overly consistent returns. Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns. An investment that continues to generate regular positive returns regardless of overall market conditions is considered suspicious.
Unregistered investments. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with financial regulators (like the SEC or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)). Registration is important because it provides investors with access to key information about the company's management, products, services, and finances.
Unlicensed sellers. In the United States, federal and state securities laws require that investment professionals and their firms be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.
Secretive or complex strategies. Investments that cannot be understood or on which no complete information can be found or obtained are considered suspicious.
Issues with paperwork. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds are not being invested as promised.
Difficulty receiving payments. Investors should be suspicious of cases where they don't receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying put.
According to criminologist Marie Springer, the following red flags can also be of relevance:

The sales personnel or adviser are overly pushy or aggressive (may involve high-pressure sales).
The initial contact took place by a cold call or through a social network, a language-based radio or a religious radio advertisement.
The client cannot determine the actual trades or investments that have been carried out.
The clients are asked to write checks with a different name than the name of the corporation (such as an individual) or to send checks to a different address than the corporate address.
Once the maturity date of their investment arrives, clients are pressured to roll over the principal and the profits.


== Methods ==
Typically, Ponzi schemes require an initial investment and promise above-average returns. They use vague verbal guises such as ""hedge futures trading"", ""high-yield investment programs"", or ""offshore investment"" to describe their income strategy. It is common for the operator to take advantage of a lack of investor knowledge or competence, or sometimes claim to use a proprietary, secret investment strategy to avoid giving information about the scheme.

The basic premise of a Ponzi scheme is ""to rob Peter to pay Paul"". Initially, the operator pays high returns to attract investors and entice current investors to invest more money. When other investors begin to participate, a cascade effect begins. The schemer pays a ""return"" to initial investors from the investments of new participants, rather than from genuine profits.
Often, high returns encourage investors to leave their money in the scheme, so that the operator does not actually have to pay very much to investors. The operator simply sends statements showing how much they have earned, which maintains the deception that the scheme is an investment with high returns. Investors within a Ponzi scheme may face difficulties when trying to get their money out of the investment.
Operators also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors where money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time in exchange for higher returns. The operator sees new cash flows as investors cannot transfer money. If a few investors do wish to withdraw their money in accordance with the terms allowed, their requests are usually promptly processed, which gives the illusion to all other investors that the fund is solvent and financially sound.
Ponzi schemes sometimes begin as legitimate investment vehicles, such as hedge funds that can easily degenerate into a Ponzi-type scheme if they unexpectedly lose money or fail to legitimately earn the returns expected. The operators fabricate false returns or produce fraudulent audit reports instead of admitting their failure to meet expectations, from which point on the operation can be considered a Ponzi scheme.
A wide variety of investment vehicles and strategies, typically legitimate, have become the basis of Ponzi schemes. For instance, Allen Stanford used bank certificates of deposit to defraud tens of thousands of people. Certificates of deposit are usually low-risk and insured instruments, but the Stanford certificates of deposit were fraudulent.


== Unraveling ==
Theoretically, it is possible for certain Ponzi schemes to ultimately ""succeed"" financially, at least as long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably ""make good"" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment. Moreover, if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting to cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading). Especially with investment vehicles like hedge funds that are regulated and monitored less heavily than other investment vehicles such as mutual funds, in the absence of a whistleblower or accompanying illegal acts, any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately implode.
Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities, it falls apart for one or more of the following reasons:

The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money. Promoters who intend to abscond often attempt to do so as returns due to be paid are about to exceed new investments, as this is when the investment capital available will be at its maximum.
Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing). Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.
External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the 2008 financial crisis), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.
In some cases, two or more of the aforementioned factors may be at play. For example, news of a police investigation into a Ponzi scheme may cause investors to immediately demand their money, and in turn cause the promoters to flee the jurisdiction sooner than planned (assuming they intended to eventually abscond in the first place), thus causing the scheme to collapse much faster than if the police investigation had simply been permitted to run its course.


== Similar schemes ==


=== Pyramid scheme ===
A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:

In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.
A pyramid scheme usually collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short-term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.


=== Cryptocurrency Ponzi ===
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs"", has been one such method, known as ""smart Ponzis"" per the Financial Times. Most schemes have a low recovery rate with investors losing their funds permanently. 
The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these pseudo-assets. Also, the pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions and their international nature involving countless jurisdictions in many different countries can make it much more difficult to identify and take legal action (whether civil or criminal) against perpetrators.
The May 2022 collapse of TerraUSD, a stablecoin propped up by a complex algorithmic mechanism offering 20% yields, was described as ""Ponzinomics"" by Wired. Another example of a well known Ponzi scheme involving cryptoassets was the ICO of AriseBank or AriseCoin, involving claims about founding the world's first ""decentralized bank"". The SEC successfully recovered the funds stolen in the ICO. A similar scheme was perpetrated by the founders of the fraudulent cryptocurrency Bitconnect.
In September 2022, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, described cryptocurrencies as ""Decentralised Ponzi Schemes"".


=== Economic bubble ===
Economic bubbles are also similar to Ponzi schemes in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until the inevitable collapse. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs in the case of the first, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:

In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which much more closely resembles a Ponzi scheme than other types of bubbles. Economist Robert J. Shiller referred to a bubble as a ""naturally occurring Ponzi"", meaning it is ""a bubble that forms not in response to a manipulator's baton but to natural market forces, with one person's expectations stoking the next person's.""
Ponzi schemes usually result in criminal charges when authorities discover them but, other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not necessarily involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone perpetuates the bubble by knowingly and deliberately misrepresenting facts to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme). Even when this occurs, wrongdoing (and especially criminal activity) is often much more difficult to prove in court compared to a Ponzi scheme. Therefore, the collapse of an economic bubble rarely results in criminal charges (which require proof beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a conviction) and, even when charges are pursued, they are often against corporations, which can be easier to pursue in court compared to charges against people but also can only result in fines as opposed to jail time. The more commonly-pursued legal recourse in situations where someone suspects an economic bubble is the result of nefarious activity is to sue for damages in civil court, where the standard of proof is only balance of probabilities and where the plaintiff need not demonstrate mens rea.
In some jurisdictions, following the collapse of a Ponzi scheme, even the ""innocent"" beneficiaries are liable to repay any gains for distribution to the victims. In this context, ""innocent"" beneficiaries can include anyone who unwittingly profited without being aware of the fraudulent nature of the scheme, and even charities to which perpetrators often give to relatively generously while a scheme is in operation in an effort to enhance their own profile and thereby ""profit"" from the resulting positive media coverage. This typically does not happen in the case of an economic bubble, especially if nobody can prove the bubble was caused by anyone acting in bad faith. Moreover, a person whose own participation in a bubble is not particularly notable is not likely to enhance participation in the bubble and thus personally profit by donating to charity.
Items traded in an economic bubble are much more likely to have an intrinsic value that is worth a substantial proportion of the market price. Therefore, following collapse of an economic bubble (especially one in a commodity such as real estate) the items affected will often retain some value, whereas an investment that is part of a Ponzi scheme will typically be worthless (or very close to worthless). On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain financing for many items that are the frequent subject of bubbles. If an investor trading on margin or borrowing to finance investments becomes the victim of a bubble, he or she can still lose all (or a very substantial portion) of his or her investment capital, or even be liable for losses in excess of the original capital investment.


=== Exit scam ===
A Ponzi scheme which ultimately terminates with the operator absconding is similar to an exit scam. The main difference is that an exit scam does not involve any sort of investment vehicle with the accompanying promised returns. Instead, exit scammers either accept payment for product which they never ship (usually after gaining a reputation for reliably shipping of products) or steal funds held in escrow on behalf of third parties (the latter often involves the operators of illegal darknet markets that facilitate the sale of illicit goods and services).


== Related concepts ==


=== Ponzi finance ===
The term ""Ponzi finance"" generally designates non-sustainable patterns of finance, such as borrowers who can only meet their debt commitment if they continuously obtain new sources of financing, often at an accelerating pace and/or ever-increasing interest rates until the borrower cannot secure more financing at any interest rate and becomes insolvent. The term was first coined by economist Hyman Minsky.


=== Ponzi game ===
In economics, the term ""Ponzi game"" designates a hypothesis where a government continuously defers the repayment of its public debt by issuing new debt: each time its existing debt arrives at maturity, it borrows funds from new and/or existing lenders in order to repay its existing debt.

"An age verification system, also known as an age gate, is any technical system that externally verifies a person's age. These systems are used primarily to restrict access to content classified, either voluntarily or by local laws, as being inappropriate for users under a specific age, such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, video games with objectionable content, pornography, or to remain in compliance with online privacy laws that regulate the collection of personal information from minors, such as COPPA in the United States.
Age verification substantially increased in 2023–2024, with the passage of the Online Safety Act 2023 in the UK, a law in France, laws in eight  U.S. states including Texas and Utah, and proposals at the federal level in the US, Canada, Denmark, and the EU.


== Methods ==


=== Birth date ===
The most basic form of age verification is to require a person to input their date of birth on a form. However, this depends on an honor system that assumes the honesty of the end user. The person may, for instance, be a minor who fraudulently inserts a valid date that meets the age criteria, rather than their own. For this reason the system has been described as ineffective.


=== Credit card verification ===
Age verification systems requiring people to provide credit card information depend on an assumption that the vast majority of credit card holders are adults, because U.S. credit card companies did not originally issue cards to minors. Additionally, a minor may still attempt to obtain their parent's credit card information, or persuade or defraud users into divulging their credit card number to an individual to use for their own purposes, defeating the stated purpose of the system.
In 2005, Salvatore LoCascio pleaded guilty to charges of credit card fraud; one of his schemes had involved using credit card-based age verification systems to charge users for ""free"" tours of adult entertainment websites.


=== Federated identification ===
Aylo, a major operator of porn websites, operates an age verification provider known as AgeID. First introduced in Germany in 2015, it uses third-party providers to authenticate the user's age, and a single sign-on model that allows the verified identity to be shared across any participating website.


=== Face recognition ===
The Australian government has proposed countering identity fraud through the use of a facial recognition system that compares individuals with official identification photos.


=== Facial age estimation ===
Facial age estimation uses machine learning to estimate the user's age by analysing their facial features in a selfie while ensuring that they are a real person and not a photograph or wearing a mask by using a liveness test.


=== Zero-knowledge proof ===
Zero-knowledge proofs verify a person's age without the person disclosing their identity, either to the receiver, such as a business, or the verifying entity, like a government that issues a passport.


=== Knowledge ===
The adult-oriented video game franchise Leisure Suit Larry presented players with trivia questions that, in the opinion of franchise creator Al Lowe, a child would not know the answer to (such as, for example, ""All politicians are: a. hard-working, b. honest, c. on the public payroll""), in order to launch the game (although this can be bypassed with a keyboard shortcut).


=== By analysing hand movements ===
In 2024, Needemand launched its Borderage service
A web service that uses a webcam and hand movements to differentiate between minors and adults. The service has been tested by independent associations (ACCS, AVPA, NCOSE), which have described Borderage as ‘One of the most advanced age verification systems’, as well as by private companies and governments, in particular Australia and the states of Arizona and Utah (USA).
A low-resolution video is taken and the surfer is asked to make 2 specific movements. If the face is detected, the application cuts the camera feed. An AI analysis is performed, and the web user is sent back to the site he or she is visiting. Depending on the result, the site decides whether or not to let the user in. This is the first application in the world that allows visitors to remain anonymous, since no personal data is requested.


== Legal mandates ==


=== Australia ===
Australia intended to implement requirements for age verification under the Online Safety Act 2021. In August 2023, Minister for Communications Michelle Rowland released a report by eSafety that recommended against such a scheme, finding that ""at present, each type of age verification or age assurance technology comes with its own privacy, security, effectiveness or implementation issue"", and suggesting that an industry code be adopted to promote the use of content filtering software to parents.
In May 2024, the federal government allocated A$6.5 million from the 2024 Australian federal budget to a pilot age verification scheme meant to protect children from accessing pornography and other harmful digital content in response to a sharp rise in domestic violence nationally.
On 10 September 2024, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Minister for Communications Michelle Rowland confirmed that the federal government would introduce legislation to enforce a minimum age for access to social media and other relevant digital platforms. The federal government would also work with states and territorial governments to develop a uniform framework. Albanese said that the legislation was intended to safeguard the safety and mental and physical health of young people while Rowland said that the proposed legislation would hold big tech to account for harmful online environments and social media addiction among children. The minimum age is likely to be set between 14 and 16 years of age. The federal government's announcement followed South Australia's plan to restrict social media access to people aged 14 and above, and the Coalition's promise to restrict social media access to people aged 16 if it won the 2025 Australian federal election.
The federal government's moves to impose a social media age limit was supported by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns, South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas,  Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan and Queensland Premier Steven Miles. The Coalition's communications spokesman David Coleman said social media age verification should be limited to those aged 16 and above. In response, the Australian Association of Psychologists director Carly Dober described the Government's proposed social media age limit as a ""bandaid response to a very complicated and deeply entrenched issue"". She also said that the ban ignored the benefits that online spaces could offer to young people, especially those from marginalised communities. Similar criticism was echoed by Daniel Angus, director of the Queensland University of Technology Digital Media Research Centre, and the Australian Internet regulator, the eSafety Commissioner, who expressed concern that a social media ban would exclude young people from ""meaningful"" digital engagement and access to critical support.
On 7 November, Prime Minister Albanese confirmed that the government would introduce legislation in November to ban young people under the age of 16 from using social media. The proposed legislation would not include exemptions for young people who already have social media accounts or those with parental consent. The children's advocacy group Australian Child Rights Taskforce criticised the proposed law as a ""blunt instrument"" and urged the Albanese government to instead impose safety standards on social media platforms. By contrast, the 36Months initiative has supported the social media age limit on the grounds that excessive social media usage was ""rewiring young brains"" and causing an ""epidemic of mental illness"".
On 21 November, the Albanese government introduced the Online Safety Amendment, legislation that would ban young people under the age of 16 from accessing social media and proposed fines of up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) on social media platforms for systemic breaches. The proposed law would affect Facebook, Instagram, TikTok,  X (formerly Twitter) and Snapchat. However, Albanese confirmed that children would still have access to messaging, online gaming, and health and education-related services including the youth mental health platform Headspace, Google Classroom and YouTube. The opposition Liberals intend to support the legislation while the Australian Greens have sought more details on the proposed law.


=== Canada ===
The proposed legislation Bill S-210—which passed the Senate in 2023 and began committee review in the House of Commons in late-May 2024, would prohibit organizations from making ""sexually explicit"" material available on the internet for commercial purposes to users under the age of 18, unless an age verification system is implemented, or the content has a legitimate artistic, educational, or scientific purpose. The bill has been criticized for privacy implications, not specifically specifying a required form of age verification, and freedom of expression concerns surrounding its scope—which can include social networking and online video services, and allow for blocking of entire websites to users in Canada if they do not comply with orders issued under the bill—even if the rest of the content is otherwise non-pornographic.


=== China ===

On August 30, 2021, the State Press and Publication Administration issued the Notice of the State Press and Publication Administration on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Being Addicted to Online Games, which stipulates that all online game enterprises may only provide online game services to minors for one hour from 20:00 to 21:00 daily on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, and may not provide online game services to minors in any form at other times.


=== Germany ===
In Germany age verification systems are mandated by the ""Jugendmedienschutz-Staatsvertrag"" which was introduced in September 2002. The institution in charge KJM considers only systems equivalent to face-to-face verification as sufficient for age verification.


=== United Kingdom ===
With the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2017, the United Kingdom passed a law containing a legal mandate on the provision of age verification. Under the act, websites that publish pornography on a commercial basis would have been required to implement a ""robust"" age verification system. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) was charged with enforcing this legislation. After a series of setbacks and public backlash, the planned scheme was eventually abandoned in 2019.
While the UK government abandoned this legislation, age verification continues to be monitored and enforced by regulatory bodies including Ofcom and the ICO. Other standards are emerging for age assurance systems, such as PAS1296:2018. The ISO standard for age assurance systems (PWI 7732) is also being developed by the Age Check Certificate Scheme, the Age Verification Providers’ Association, and other Conformity Assessment Bodies.
In 2023, Parliament passed the Online Safety Act 2023. It requires that websites containing pornographic material verify that users are over 18, with effect from 25 July 2025. Major pornographic websites have announced an intention to comply with the new rules, as has the social networking site Bluesky.


=== United States ===

Some websites of alcoholic beverage companies attempt to verify the age of visitors so that they can confirm they are at least the American legal drinking age of 21.
In 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) took effect at the federal level, resulting in some websites adding age verification for visitors under the age of 13, and some websites disallowing accounts for users under the age of 13. Companies such as YouTube and ByteDance have received large fines from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for not complying with COPPA.
In 2022, Louisiana became the first state to require age verification for accessing adult websites. Usage of LA Wallet, the state's digital ID and mobile drivers license app, subsequently spiked, as LA Wallet allows for remote identification via MindGeek, the owner of many major porn sites.
In 2023, several states, including Arkansas and Utah, passed social media addiction bills requiring users of social media platforms to be over the age of 18 or have parental consent, with these bills prescribing that age verification be used to enforce this requirement. One such bill is the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, which is scheduled to take effect in 2024, and attempts to prevent minors from using social media from 10:30 PM to 6:30 AM.
In May 2023, a law passed in Utah requiring that pornography websites verify the ages of their visitors, although it has a clause that bars it from taking effect until five other states also implement similar measures. A few days before the law passed, in order to protest the bill, Pornhub blocked their website from being viewed in Utah. The trade group Free Speech Coalition filed a lawsuit against the state of Utah, claiming the law violated the First Amendment. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Court Judge Ted Stewart on August 1, 2023; however, the Free Speech Coalition stated they would appeal this ruling.
In contrast, on August 31, 2023, US District Judge David Ezra invalidated a Texas law passed in June mandating age verification and health warnings before accessing pornographic websites following a lawsuit from the Free Speech Coalition, and barred the state attorney general's office from enforcing the law on the grounds that it violates the right to free speech and is overly broad and vague. The Texas Attorney General's office stated they would appeal the ruling. The 5th Circuit federal court of appeal overturned the injunction pending a full hearing. The Free Speech Coalition petitioned to the Supreme Court to hear the case, which certified the case to be heard during its 2024–2025 term.

"Geo-blocking, geoblocking or geolocking is technology that restricts access to Internet content based upon the user's geographical location. In a geo-blocking scheme, the user's location is determined using Internet geolocation techniques, such as checking the user's IP address against a blacklist or whitelist, GPS queries in the case of a mobile device, accounts, and measuring the end-to-end delay of a network connection to estimate the physical location of the user. IP address location tracking—a field pioneered by Cyril Houri, the inventor of one of the first systems capable of identifying a user's geographical location via their IP address—is typically used for geo-blocking. This technology has become widely used in fraud prevention, advertising, and content localization, which are integral to geo-blocking applications. The result of the checks is used to determine whether the system will approve or deny access to the website or to particular content. The geolocation may also be used to modify the content provided: for example, the currency in which goods are quoted, the price or the range of goods that are available.
The term is most commonly associated with its use to restrict access to premium multimedia content on the Internet, such as films and television shows, primarily for copyright and licensing reasons. There are other uses for geo-blocking, such as blocking malicious traffic or to enforce price discrimination, location-aware authentication, fraud prevention, and online gambling (where gambling laws vary by region). Websites also use geo-blocking to comply with sanctions rules and regulations.


== Justification ==
The ownership of exclusive territorial rights to audiovisual works may differ between regions, requiring the providers of the content to disallow access for users outside of their designated region; for example, although an online service, HBO Now is only available to residents of the United States, and cannot be offered in other countries because its parent network HBO had already licensed exclusive rights to its programming to different broadcasters (such as in Canada, where HBO licensed its back-catalogue to Bell Media), who may offer their own, similar service specific to their own region and business model (such as Crave). For similar reasons, the library of content available on subscription video on demand services such as Netflix may also vary between regions, or the service may not even be available in the user's country at all.
Geo-blocking can be used for other purposes as well. Price discrimination by online stores can be enforced by geo-blocking, forcing users to buy products online from a foreign version of a site where prices may be unnecessarily higher than those of their domestic version (although the inverse is often the case). The ""Australia Tax"" has been cited as an example of this phenomenon, which has led to governmental pressure to restrict how geo-blocking can be used in this manner in the country.
Geo-blocking is also applied to enforce compliance with local laws and regulations. One notable example is the Ligue contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme et Union des étudiants juifs de France v. Yahoo! (LICRA v. Yahoo!) case in 2000. The Tribunal de grande instance of Paris ruled that Yahoo! must prevent French users from accessing its auction sites where Nazi memorabilia were being sold, in violation of Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code, and it was demonstrated that IP geolocation could be used to filter at least 90% of traffic coming from France.
Other noted uses include blocking access from countries that a particular website is not relevant to (especially if the majority of traffic from that country is malicious), and voluntarily blocking access to content or services that are illegal under local laws. This can include online gambling, and various international websites blocking access to users within the European Economic Area due to concerns of liability under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).


== Circumvention ==
Geo-blocking can be circumvented. When IP address-based geo-blocking is employed, virtual private network (VPN) and anonymizer services can be used to evade geo-blocks. A user can, for example, access a website using a U.S. IP address in order to access content or services that are not available from outside the country. Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and BBC iPlayer are among the foreign video services widely used through these means by foreign users. Its popularity among VPN users in the country prompted Netflix to officially establish an Australian version of its service in 2014. In response to complaints over the quality of domestic coverage by NBC, along with a requirement for viewers be a subscriber to a participating pay television provider in order to access the online content, a large number of American viewers used VPN services to stream foreign online coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2014 Winter Olympics from British and Canadian broadcasters. Unlike NBC's coverage, this foreign coverage only used a geo-block and did not require a TV subscription.
However, many services, including Netflix, Hulu, and even Wikipedia, have implemented measures to recognize and limit or block the use of VPNs by identifying IP addresses associated with such services. This limits users' ability to access geo-blocked content through VPNs or anonymizers.
In 2009, Venezuela subsidized the launch of the communications satellite Venesat-1, in part to amplify Telesur's programming by enabling it to avoid geo-blocking efforts by DirectTV, an American company.
In 2013, the New Zealand internet service provider Slingshot introduced a similar feature known as ""global mode""; initially intended for travellers to enable access to local websites blocked in New Zealand, the service was re-launched in July 2014 as a feature to all Slingshot subscribers. The consumer-focused re-launch focused on its ability to provide access to U.S. online video services. Unlike manually-configured VPN services, Global Mode was implemented passively at the ISP level and was automatically activated based on a whitelist, without any further user intervention.


== Legality of circumvention for online video ==
The legality of circumventing geo-blocking to access foreign video services under local copyright laws is unclear and varies by country. Members of the entertainment industry (including broadcasters and studios) have contended that the use of VPNs and similar services to evade geo-blocking by online video services is a violation of copyright laws, as the foreign service does not hold the rights to make its content available in the user's country—thus infringing and undermining the rights held by a local rights holder. Accessing online video services from outside the country in which they operate is typically considered a violation of their respective terms of use; some services have implemented measures to block VPN users, despite there being legitimate uses for such proxy services, under the assumption that they are using them to evade geographic filtering.
Leaked e-mails from the 2014 Sony Pictures hack revealed statements by Keith LeGoy, Sony Pictures Television's president of international distribution, describing the international usage of Netflix over VPN services as being ""semi-sanctioned"" piracy that helped to illicitly increase its market share, and criticizing the company for not taking further steps to prevent usage of the service outside of regions where they have licenses to their content, such as detecting ineligible users via their payment method. On 14 January 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to prevent subscribers from accessing regional versions of the service that they are not authorized to use.


=== Australia ===
In Australia, a policy FAQ published by then Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, states that users violating an ""international commercial arrangement to protect copyright in different countries or regions"" is not illegal under copyright law of Australia. However, an amendment to Australian copyright law allows courts to order the blocking of websites that primarily engage in ""facilitating"" copyright infringement—a definition which could include VPN services that market themselves specifically for the purpose of evading geo-blocking. Prior to the passing of this amendment in June 2015, Turnbull acknowledged that VPN services have ""a wide range of legitimate uses, not least of which is the preservation of privacy—something which every citizen is entitled to secure for themselves—and [VPN providers] have no oversight, control or influence over their customers' activities.""


=== European Union ===
On 6 May 2015, the European Union announced the adoption of its ""Digital Single Market"" strategy, which would, among other changes, aim to end the use of ""unjustified"" geo-blocking between EU countries, arguing that ""too many Europeans cannot use online services that are available in other EU countries, often without any justification; or they are re-routed to a local store with different prices. Such discrimination cannot exist in a Single Market."" However, proposals issued by the European Commission on 25 May 2016 excluded the territorial licensing of copyrighted audiovisual works from this strategy.
On 1 April 2018, new digital media portability rules took effect, which requires paid digital media services to offer ""roaming"" within the EU. This means that, for example, a subscriber to Netflix in one EU country must still be able to access their home country's version of the service when travelling into other EU countries.
The European Union has approved the Regulation on Measures to Combat Unjustified Geoblocking and Other Forms of Discrimination Based on Citizenship, Place of Residence or Location of a Person in the Internal Market, which entered into force on 3 December 2018.
The geo-blocking regulation aims to provide more options for consumers and businesses in the EU internal market. It addresses the problem that (potential) customers cannot buy goods and services from sellers located in another Member State for reasons related to their citizenship, place of residence or location, and therefore discriminate against them when they try to get access to the best offers, prices or terms of sale compared to the nationals or residents of the member state of the sellers.
The new rules only apply if the other party is a consumer or a company that purchases services or products exclusively for end use (B2C, B2B). Geo-blocking regulation does not apply if products are sold to business customers for commercial purposes. The Geoblocking Ordinance does not completely prohibit geoblocking and geo-discrimination: it only prohibits certain forms.
Geo-blocking regulations prohibit geo-blocking and geo-discrimination in three situations:

It is not permitted to deny website visitors access to it or automatically redirect them to another website depending on their location. Redirection is only allowed with the consent of the visitor. Similar rules apply to apps as well: they must be able to download and use them throughout the EU.
The rules apply to the means of payment accepted on the site. A payment method cannot be refused because the customer or his / or her bank is located in another EU Member State or because the means of payment was issued in another EU Member State. Other payment terms and higher transaction costs are also prohibited.
In certain situations, it is no longer allowed to apply other general conditions to foreign customers:
when providing digital services such as cloud services and web hosting;
when providing services in a physical location, such as renting cars or selling tickets for an event;
When selling goods and offering, either deliver them to a specific area or collect them in a specific place (for example, a store).
The prohibition of direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of citizenship is a fundamental principle of EU law. In situations not covered by this Regulation, Article 20 (2) of the Services Directive (2006/123 / EC) may apply. According to this provision, sellers can only apply a difference of treatment based on nationality or place of residence if this is justified by objective criteria. In some cases, industry-specific legislation (such as transport or health) may also apply that addresses this issue. In addition, the Regulation does not affect the TFEU rules, including the non-discrimination rules.


=== New Zealand ===
In April 2015, a group of media companies in New Zealand, including MediaWorks, Spark, Sky Network Television, and TVNZ, jointly sent cease and desist notices to several ISPs offering VPN services for the purpose of evading geo-blocking, demanding that they pledge to discontinue the operation of these services by 15 April 2015, and to inform their customers that such services are ""unlawful"". The companies accused the ISPs of facilitating copyright infringement by violating their exclusive territorial rights to content in the country, and misrepresenting the alleged legality of the services in promotional material. In particular, Spark argued that the use of VPNs to access foreign video on demand services was cannibalizing its own domestic service Lightbox. At least two smaller providers (Lightwire Limited and Unlimited Internet) announced that they would pull their VPN services in response to the legal concerns. However, CallPlus, the parent company of Slingshot and Orcon, objected to the claims, arguing that the Global Mode service was ""completely legal"", and accused the broadcasters of displaying protectionism. Later that month, it was reported that the broadcasters planned to go forward with legal action against CallPlus.
On 24 June 2015, it was announced that the media companies reached an out-of-court settlement, in which ByPass Network Services, who operates the service, would discontinue it effective 1 September 2015.

"The ADE 651 is a fraudulent bomb detector produced by the British company Advanced Tactical Security & Communications Ltd (ATSC). It was claimed to detect many substances, such as drugs or explosives, from long distances. The device was sold to various countries, particularly in Iraq where the government was claimed to have spent £52 million for security operations. The product was invented by Jim McCormick, ATSC's managing director and a former Merseyside policeman.
The device features a swiveling antenna attached to a plastic grip and requires charging by a user's static electricity. Users would insert ""programmed substance detection cards"" to supposedly detect specific substances, which were claimed to absorb the vapors of those substances. However, investigations revealed that the product was incapable of detecting anything, essentially being a dowsing rod. The ADE 651 was used primarily by Iraqi security forces for security checkpoints. Due to the false sense of security, many critics pointed to numerous incidents where bombings occurred despite the presence of the ADE 651 at security checkpoints, underscoring its ineffectiveness.
In 2010, the British government banned the exportation of the device to Iraq and Afghanistan after military officials' claims of its ineffectiveness. McCormick was later arrested on the suspicion of fraud. He was later convicted on three counts of fraud, receiving a ten-year prison sentence in April 2013.


== Device ==

The ADE 651 consists of a swivelling antenna mounted via hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk for a few moments to ""charge"" it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific ""programmed substance detection card"" is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna in the direction of the target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to ""tune into"" the ""frequency"" of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card.
Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, described the proper use of the device as more of an art than a science. ""If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try to clear my mind."" The cards were supposedly ""programmed"" or ""activated"" by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's ""vapours"". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to ""program"" the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of ""programming"" them when demand for the devices was at its peak.
The use of the device by Iraqi and Pakistani security forces has become a major international controversy. The very similar GT200 and Alpha 6 devices, widely used in Thailand and Mexico, also came under scrutiny in the wake of the revelations about the ADE 651.
Promotional material issued by ATSC claimed that the ADE 651 could detect such item as guns, ammunition, drugs, truffles, human bodies, contraband ivory and bank notes at distances of up to 1 kilometre (0.62 mi), underground, through walls, underwater or even from aircraft at an altitude of up to 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). In a promotional video, McCormick claimed that the device could detect elephants from 48 kilometres (30 mi) away.
The ADE 651 was said to work on the principle of ""electrostatic magnetic ion attraction"". According to the promotional material, ""by programming the detection cards to specifically target a particular substance, (through the proprietary process of electrostatic matching of the ionic charge and structure of the substance), the ADE651 could ""by-pass"" all known attempts to conceal the target substance. It has been claimed to penetrate lead, concrete, and other materials (including hiding in the body) used in attempts to block the attraction."" Prosec, a Lebanese reseller of the ADE 651, claimed on its website that the device works on nuclear quadrupole resonance or nuclear magnetic resonance. McCormick told the BBC in 2010 that ""the theory behind dowsing and the theory behind how we actually detect explosives is very similar"".


== Development and manufacture ==
The ADE 651 is a descendant of the Quadro Tracker Positive Molecular Locator produced in the 1990s by Wade Quattlebaum, an American car dealer, commercial diver and treasure hunter. The Quadro Tracker was promoted by Quattlebaum initially as a device to find lost golf balls, and later as a means of detecting marijuana, cocaine, heroin, gunpowder, and dynamite using ""carbo-crystalised"" software cards. Like the ADE 651, it consisted of a hand unit on which a swinging antenna was mounted, linked to a box worn on the belt in which the cards were inserted to identify the ""molecular frequency"" of whatever the user wanted to detect. The cards were ""programmed"" by photocopying a Polaroid photograph of the target, cutting up the resulting copy, and pasting the pieces between two squares of plastic. Quattlebaum sold the devices for between $395 and $8,000 for a unit claimed to be capable of detecting humans, using a Polaroid photograph of the individual concerned for the ""programming."" A cheaper variant called the Golfinder or Gopher was available for $69.
Although the Quadro Tracker was enjoined from being manufactured or sold in the United States after a 1996 federal court case, Quadro's four principal figures escaped criminal sanctions after a jury failed to convict them. The company's secretary, Malcolm Stig Roe, moved to the United Kingdom after jumping bail and set up two new companies to sell fake detection devices. Some of the distribution agents broke away and began producing their own copies of the Quadro Tracker, such as the Alpha 6, Mole Programmable Substance Detector, Sniffex and GT200. The increase in security spending that followed the September 11 attacks in the United States opened up lucrative opportunities for sellers of security equipment.
The ADE 651's inventor was Jim McCormick, a former Merseyside Police officer and managing director of ATSC, was previously a salesman specialising in communications equipment but had no scientific or technical background. He established a private limited company (registered company 03407495) on 23 July 1997 under the name ""Broadcasting and Telecommunications Ltd"" which he subsequently renamed ""Advanced Tactical Security & Communications Ltd"" (ATSC). The company was based in a former dairy in Sparkford, Somerset. After he came across the Mole Programmable Substance Detector in 2000, McCormick signed up as a distribution agent, paying the UK-based manufacturer £10,000 for a single unit. The device was withdrawn from sale only a year later after it was investigated by Sandia National Laboratories on behalf of the US National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center, and was found to be useless.

McCormick responded to this setback by copying Quadro's Golfinder, sticking an ATSC label onto it, renaming it the ADE (Advanced Detection Equipment) 100, and marketing it as a bomb detector. Between 2005 and 2009 he produced and sold several iterations of the design. One of these, the ADE 101, was sold for up to $7,000 per unit. He also marketed a version called the ADE 650. The ADE 651 was a further development of the same design. According to an associate of ATSC, the devices were manufactured at a cost of £150 each by suppliers in Great Britain and Romania. The associate told The New York Times: ""Everyone at ATSC knew there was nothing inside the ADE 651."" A whistleblower who worked to sell the device around the world with McCormick told the BBC that he once challenged McCormick over the device's effectiveness. McCormick was said to have answered that the device did ""exactly what it's meant to ... it makes money.""
ATSC was the principal vendor of the ADE devices. Its accounts at Companies House recorded a turnover of £1.78 million for the year to 31 July 2008, with a gross profit of £1.35 million. Its sole shareholder was its owner, McCormick. A sister company at the same location, ATSC Exports Ltd (registered company 06797101), was established on 21 January 2009, also as a private limited company. It had not filed any accounts as of January 2010. There were also several resellers of ATSC's fake bomb detectors, including Cumberland Industries UK, a company based in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and Prosec of Baabda, Lebanon.


== Users ==
The device has been sold to 20 countries in the Middle East and Asia, including Iraq and Afghanistan, for as much as US$60,000 each. The Iraqi government is said to have spent £52 million on the devices. It was widely used by the Iraqi Police Service and the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi Interior Ministry bought 800 of the devices in 2008 for £20m and a further 700 in 2009 for £32m, in no-bid contracts with ATSC. The Iraqi government paid up to £37,000 for the devices despite the purchase price being put at around £11,500. The Iraqi Army's Baghdad Operations Command announced in November 2009 that it had purchased another hundred of the devices. McCormick of ATSC has said that the devices were sold for £5,000 each, with the balance of the cost going on training and middlemen. The training included instructions to Iraqi users to ""shuffle their feet to generate static electricity to make the things work.""

The ADE 651 has been used at hundreds of Iraqi police and Iraqi military checkpoints across the country, often replacing physical inspections of vehicles. Major-General Jihad al-Jabiri of the Interior Ministry's General Directorate for Combating Explosives has defended the device: ""Whether it's magic or scientific, what I care about is detecting bombs. I don't care what they say. I know more about bombs than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs than anyone in the world."" He told a press conference that the ADE 651 has detected ""hundreds of roadside bombs and car bombs"" and any deficiencies were due to defective training in the device's use. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Jawad al-Bulani, also defended the device, telling Al Iraqiya television that the ADE 651 had ""managed to prevent and detect more than 16,000 bombs that would be a threat to people's life and more than 733 car bombs were defused."" He said: ""Iraq is considered as a market area for many companies producing such devices ... and there are other rival companies trying to belittle the efficiency of these instruments the government is buying"".
In Mexico, the Government of Colima bought an ADE 651 for more than $60,000. Also, in the photography accompanying an article about the GT200 published in newspaper La-Ch.com, a Mexican soldier can be seen using an ADE 651. It is possible that the Secretariat of National Defense also bought some units.
According to a promotional website for the ADE 651, the device was also used by the Lebanese Army, the Chinese Police, the Royal Thai Police and the Interior Ministry of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraqi Kurdistan. The website claimed that the Jordanian government required hotels to employ ADE 651 devices to scan vehicles entering underground car parks. ATSC's McCormick says that 20 countries have acquired the device, with purchasers including ""the Saudis, Indian police, a Belgian drug squad, a Hong Kong correctional facility and the Chittagong navy."" The police in the Belgian municipal region of Geel-Laakdal-Meerhout used the device to detect drugs. Pakistan's Airport Security Force also used the ADE 651 as a bomb detector at the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi.


== Effectiveness ==
The use of the ADE 651 prompted strong criticism, and eventually led to a ban on the device's export from the UK to Iraq and Afghanistan and a criminal investigation of its manufacturer. The Iraqi security forces' reliance on the device was highlighted by The New York Times investigation in November 2009, which reported that United States military and technical experts believed the device was useless. US Army Major-General Richard Rowe told the newspaper that ""there's [no] magic wand that can detect explosives. If there was, we would all be using it. I have no confidence that these work"". Sandia National Laboratories had carried out testing of several similar devices but found that ""none have ever performed better than random chance"". Retired US Air Force Colonel Hal Bidlack, a former national security aide in the Clinton and Bush administrations, condemned the device as ""laughable, except someone down the street from you is counting on this to keep bombs off the streets"". An Iraqi guard and driver for The New York Times, both of whom were licensed to carry firearms, were able to drive two AK-47 rifles and ammunition through nine police checkpoints that were using the device without any of them detecting the weapons.
Iraqi civilians complained that the device seems to have ""an unerring attraction to shampoo and soapsuds"". According to Iraqi police officer Jasim Hussein, ""The vast majority of the people we stop, it's because of their perfume"". A fellow officer, Hasan Ouda, commented that ""Most people now understand it's what gets them searched, so they don't use as much."" McCormick of ATSC falsely claimed that the apparent responsiveness of the ADE 651 was due to fragrances containing traces of the explosive substance RDX.
The veteran Canadian-American skeptic and magician James Randi publicly offered one million dollars to anyone who can prove the device's effectiveness as far back as October 2008. Randi issued a statement calling the ADE 651 ""a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It's a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars."" According to Randi, nobody from ATSC ever responded.
The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the ADE 651 had been tested around 2008 in Israel but was ""kicked out of the country"". An Israeli explosives expert told the magazine: ""The thing has absolutely nothing to do with the detection of explosives"". When it was displayed at an arms and security fair in Beirut in April 2009, a visiting explosives expert described it as ""one big fraud"". Gadi Aviran, the head of the Israeli security firm Terrorgence, said: ""If someone comes to an expert, claiming that he had developed a device that can detect the smell of explosives from several meters away, the expert must know that this is physically not possible.""
The FBI has repeatedly issued alerts about dowsing rod devices being used as explosive detectors. It has described the Quadro Tracker, as ""a fraud"" and told all agencies to immediately cease using it. Another alert issued in 1999 told agencies: ""Warning. Do not use bogus explosives detection devices."" A US Army test of a similar device found that it was unable to detect a truck carrying a tonne of TNT when it drove up behind the operator. In June 2009, the US Army carried out a laboratory test including X-ray analysis on the ADE 651 that found it to be ineffective. According to Major Joe Scrocca, ""The examination resulted in a determination that there was no possible means by which the ADE 651 could detect explosives and therefore was determined to be totally ineffective and fraudulent. As a result of that study, the US military notified all military and civilian personnel in Iraq that the bomb detection device is ineffective and should not be relied upon as a means of ensuring the safety of any personnel.""
Caroline Hawley and Meirion Jones from the BBC's Newsnight programme investigated the ADE 651 in a report broadcast in January 2010, asking the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to assess one of the ""programmed substance detection cards"" used in the device to detect TNT. The laboratory found that the card contained only a standard radio frequency ID tag of the type used in stores to prevent shoplifting. According to the laboratory's Dr. Markus Kuhn, it was ""impossible"" for the card to detect anything and it had ""absolutely nothing to do with the detection of TNT"". The card could not be programmed, had no memory, no microprocessor and no form of information could be stored on it. Despite the high cost of the devices, the cards were worth only about two to three pence (3–5¢) each. Kuhn commented: ""These are the cheapest bit of electronics that you can get that look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card."" The ""card reader"" was found to be an empty plastic box. Psychology professor Bruce Hood has noted that the swinging of the antenna is merely due to its loose assembly and unconscious wrist movements by the user (ideomotor phenomenon). Explosives expert Sidney Alford described the device as ""immoral"", telling Newsnight that ""it could result in people being killed in the dozens, if not hundreds"". Newsnight noted that thousands of people had indeed been killed and injured in devastating car bomb attacks in Baghdad such as the 25 October and 8 December 2009 Baghdad bombings, without the bombers being detected by the ADE 651 devices.
McCormick refused to be interviewed for the Newsnight investigation, but told The New York Times that ATSC would remain in business: ""Our company is still fully operational."" He told The Times that ATSC had been dealing with doubters for ten years and that the device was merely being criticised because of its ""primitive"" appearance. He said: ""We are working on a new model that has flashing lights"".


== Investigations and export ban ==


=== United Kingdom ===
British and American military officers in Iraq brought the ADE 651's ineffectiveness to the attention of British police liaison officers in the country. The matter subsequently came to the notice of Colin Port, the Chief Constable of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Chair of the International Police Assistance Board, who personally ordered an investigation into McCormick and ATSC. In January 2010, ATSC's McCormick was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On 12 July 2012, McCormick was charged on three counts that between 15 January 2007, and 12 July 2012, he had in his possession or control an article for use in the course of or in connection with fraud contrary to Section 6 of the Fraud Act 2006; and three further charges that between the same dates he made or adapted, supplied or offered to supply an article knowing it was designed or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with, or intending it to be used to commit, or to assist in a fraud, contrary to Section 7 of the Fraud Act 2006.
Following the 2010 BBC Newsnight exposé of the device, the UK Government's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced that the BBC tests had shown that ""the technology used in the ADE 651 and similar devices is not suitable for bomb detection"" and they ""could cause harm to UK and other friendly forces in Iraq and Afghanistan"". It had therefore decided to ban the export of the ADE 651 and similar devices to those two countries under the Export Control Act 2002, with effect from 27 January 2010. The device had not previously been subject to export restrictions as it was non-military equipment. The department offered ""cooperation with any investigation [the Iraqi authorities] may wish to make into how the device came to be bought for their military as bomb detection equipment."" The banning order prohibited the export to Iraq and Afghanistan of ""'electro-statically powered' equipment for detecting 'explosives'"".
McCormick was tried in March–April 2013 at the Central Criminal Court in London. The court was told that ""the devices did not work and he knew they did not work. He had them manufactured so that they could be sold – and despite the fact they did not work, people bought them for a handsome but unwarranted profit."" McCormick had falsely represented himself as a member of the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, using the organisation's logo without permission. McCormick said that he had sold the ADE 651 and similar devices to security forces internationally but none had complained about them.
On 23 April 2013, McCormick was convicted on three counts of fraud. The chief investigating officer in the case, Detective Superintendent Nigel Rock, said:

There was no evidence demonstrated, that McCormick or his company ATSC UK conducted any proper research or development into the products manufactured; in fact he refused to submit the ADE devices to independent tests. He sold his detection devices to many governments, defence agencies and private institutions around the world. A large proportion of these were countries where there was and still remains a real risk of terrorism and criminality. Iraq was one country which between 2008 and 2010 bought 6,000 devices at a cost in excess of $40 million.
The devices were used at numerous checkpoints within Iraq during this period. It is clear that both civilians and armed forces personnel were put at significant risk in relying upon this equipment. McCormick showed a complete disregard for the safety of those that used and relied upon the device for their own security and protection. He amassed many millions of pounds through his greed and criminal enterprise.
It was disclosed that McCormick had made millions of pounds from sales of the ADE 651, with which he had bought a farmhouse in Somerset, Nicolas Cage's former £3.5 million house in Bath with its own basement swimming pool, holiday homes in Cyprus and Florida, a £600,000 luxury yacht, and three horses for one of his daughters. The police declared that they would seek to ""pursue his wealth"" using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
McCormick was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on 2 May 2013. In passing sentence, Richard Hone said: ""Your fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals."" The judge noted that McCormick had not expressed any remorse or recognition of wrongdoing and said that his ""culpability as a fraudster has to be placed in the highest category."" Brigadier Simon Marriner told the court that the ADE 651 was clearly implicated in failing to prevent bomb attacks: ""The inescapable conclusion is that devices have been detonated after passing through checkpoints. Iraqi civilians have died as a result.""
McCormick's application for an appeal against his sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, with Judge Elgan Edwards stating: ""The circumstances were quite appalling. The applicant knew precisely what he was doing. He did it for enormous profit and that conduct simply cannot and will not be tolerated."" The judge commented that ""if this case does not merit the maximum possible sentence, I don't know what does."" McCormick was subsequently ordered to forfeit £7,944,834 under a proceeds of crime order to recompense the organisations defrauded by him, including £2.3 million to repay Iraq. His prison sentence was extended in 2018 by a further 2 years after he refused to meet a £1.8m shortfall in these repayments. He was released in 2019.


=== Iraq ===

The failure of the ADE 651 to prevent a series of bombings in Baghdad and the circumstances of its procurement raised concerns in Iraq even before it became the subject of media exposés. The New York Times reported in November 2009 that Aqeel al-Turaihi, the Iraqi Interior Ministry's inspector-general, had begun an investigation into the contracts that the ministry had signed with ATSC. The Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki, also ordered an investigation into the effectiveness of the devices following several bomb attacks. The Iraqi parliament did not order an official investigation but Iraqi MP Nadeem al-Jabiri said: ""the security and defence committee in the parliament, headed by Hadi al-Amiri, is following up this matter as part of the parliament's duty as a monitoring entity."" The Interior Ministry's report noted that ""many lives have been lost due to the wands' utter ineffectiveness"". The report and investigation were later suppressed, and it has been alleged that corruption was the reason, as 75% of the value of the contract ""went to kickbacks received by [Iraqi] officials"".
The BBC's revelations in January 2010 caused outrage in Iraq. A police officer told The New York Times: ""Our government is to be blamed for all the thousands of innocent spirits who were lost since these devices have been used in Iraq."" MP Ammar Tuma of the Iraqi Parliament's Security and Defense Committee said: ""This company not only caused grave and massive losses of funds, but it has caused grave and massive losses of the lives of innocent Iraqi civilians, by the hundreds and thousands, from attacks that we thought we were immune to because we have this device."" He told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper: ""The tasks of the committee are limited to two tracks, [and that is] reaching the truth over what happened with regards to the signing of the contracts for these bomb detection devices; firstly by following up on the details of the contract and looking at the background of this, as well as the possibility of collusion by those who signed this contract, or whether this [ineffectiveness] is the result of technical weaknesses in these devices. Either of these [options] deserves accountability."" He said that Defence Minister Abd al-Qadr Muhammed Jassim al-Obaidi had informed the Iraqi Parliament during emergency parliamentary hearings in 2009 that ""the detection of car bombs and explosive material using these devices is very limited, and this increases the likelihood that these devices have low efficiency.""
Another MP, Hussain al-Falluji, demanded that Iraqi security forces immediately cease using the ADE 651. His proposal to establish an investigative committee and seek to recover the money spent on the devices was supported by other parliamentarians. Hadi Al-Ameri, the head of the Parliament's Security and Defense Committee, said that he would push for an official investigation to ""find out how this piece of equipment was sold to Iraq."" If it was determined that ATSC was responsible he planned to ""seek compensation via the ministry of foreign affairs."" MP Haneen Kado said: ""If we rely on these devices there is no point in having checkpoints. It makes the whole of Baghdad open to terrorist attacks. We are in a dangerous situation and there could be new bombings at any time. We must investigate exactly who bought and sold these detectors and see that they answer in court.""
The Supreme Board of Audit in Iraq announced an investigation into the procurement of the ADE 651, focusing on the officials who had previously given assurances of the device's technical soundness. The Iraqi Army's Baghdad Operations Command, which had previously procured 100 of the devices, distanced itself from their use. Major General Qassim al-Moussawi said: ""The devices have helped us in parts of our work but in some aspects they are not useful. Their performance does not match our aspirations. There is some percent of error in their performance and these devices must be updated."" Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was reported to have ordered a new investigation of how the devices had been procured, looking into whether there was any corruption involved.
According to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's inspector-general Aqil al-Turehi, he had investigated the device in 2008 but found it ""inoperative"" and costly and recommended that Iraq should not buy it. He told Reuters: ""There was corruption associated with this contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior. We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally in the field of explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device."" Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been ""marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions."" The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al-Turehi's concerns. An unnamed Iraqi officer told the Agence France-Presse that ""We know it doesn't work and that it has been banned [in Britain], but we are continuing to use it. It is bullshit. But still we are lying about it.""
Despite the controversy, the device continued to be used at checkpoints across Iraq. The Iraqi Interior Ministry has defended the continued use of the ADE 651. In 2010, the then-head of the ministry's counter-explosives unit, General Jihad al-Jabiri, told the BBC that his organisation had ""conducted several tests on them, and found them successful. In addition, we have a series of achievements officially documented by the Baghdad operations centre, from all the provinces, which establish that these devices detected thousands of bombs, booby-trapped houses and car bombs, and we've noticed a reduction of bombing activities to less than 10 per cent of what it was."" A senior ministry official, Assistant Deputy Minister General Tareq al-Asl, told Asharq Al-Awsat: ""The reason the director of the company was arrested was not because the device doesn't work, but because he refused to divulge the secret of how it works to the British authorities, and the Americans before them. I have tested it in practice and it works effectively and 100% reliably.""
In February 2011, General al-Jabiri was arrested on corruption charges, centering on the ADE 651 device purchase. He was subsequently convicted of taking millions of dollars of bribes from McCormick and was imprisoned along with two other Iraqi officials. Up to 15 Iraqis are said to have been on McCormick's payroll, receiving money through a bank in Beirut.
Aqil al-Turehi said that he ""feel[s] furious when I think that this gang of Jim McCormick and the Iraqis working with him killed my people by creating false security and selling such a useless device"". In one incident, a vehicle carrying rockets and missiles travelled undetected through 23 Baghdad checkpoints equipped with the ADE 651. The false sense of security provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that her life had been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: ""When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt. How could he sell them just for money and destroy other people's lives?""
Fake bomb detectors such as the ADE 651 were still in use in Iraq as late as July 2016, and may have contributed to the July 2016 Baghdad bombings. This led to Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, to order police to stop using the detectors.


=== Pakistan ===
Pakistan purchased ADE 651s for use by the Airports Security Force (ASF). After the ADE 651 became the focus of controversy for its role in Iraq, concerns were raised in Pakistan about its employment as a bomb detector by the ASF. A senior official at Jinnah International Airport denied that the ADE 651 was being used, claiming that the ASF had designed the device in use there, but other ASF officials acknowledged that their device ""operated on the same principle as ADE-651."" Pakistani scientists rejected the scientific basis on which the device was claimed to work: Professor Shahid Zaidi of Karachi University told the Pakistani newspaper Dawn that ""there has to be an electric, magnetic or electromagnetic field for a device to work in such a manner. Furthermore static fields don’t move around the way it is being claimed by some. Also don’t forget that there are so many radio waves of different frequencies all around us. I just don’t see how this device would work."" Dawn challenged the ASF to test the device to confirm its effectiveness but the ASF refused, insisting that the device works.


=== Belgium ===
The Belgian police bought an ADE 651 in 2008 for £12,800 to detect drugs, as a supposedly cheaper alternative to a dog. According to Superintendent Thierry Meunier, it was soon apparent that it was ineffective: ""We had no results from it. We tried to use the device for detecting drugs in cars for several months. We also provided the detector to detectives seeking to detect drugs. The results again were negative.""


=== Lebanon ===
The Lebanese Army bought ADE 651s. In addition, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) bought five ADE 651s at a cost of £46,000 to detect explosives in vehicles. ATSC offered the UN a further 80 of the devices, but declined to provide evidence that the ADE 651 could do what was claimed and suggested that the UN should carry out its own tests. UNIFIL did so over the course of two days but found that the device was ""not fit for purpose"".


=== Other countries ===
The ADE 651 was also sold to customers in Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Georgia, India, Iran, Kenya, Niger, Qatar, Romania, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. The Mövenpick Hotel in Bahrain bought one to detect car bombs but, according to the hotel's head of security, who gave evidence to the Old Bailey trial, it could not even detect a firework: ""It wasn’t working. It wasn’t working at all"". The Mövenpick hotel ceased using the device following the intervention of the Bahrain Ministry of Interior in mid 2010 at the beginning of an enquiry in co-operation with UK Police which continued until the trial of McCormick in April 2013.


== Similar devices ==

The Quadro Tracker, also known as the Positive Molecular Locator, was a similar device sold by Quadro Corp. of Harleyville, South Carolina between 1993 and 1996.
An apparent recycling of the Quadro Tracker turned up as the DKLabs Lifeguard, which had a similar appearance and made ambitious claims about being able to locate survivors missing under rubble or hiding in shipping containers. It has been proven to be useless in tests by Sandia National Labs.
Another ""remote substance detector"" device, the Global Technical GT200, has come under scrutiny in Thailand in the wake of the controversy over the ADE 651. The Bangkok Post reports that the GT200 is virtually identical to the ADE 651 and has been described by critics as a ""divining rod"" which uses ""controller cards"", like the ADE 651, to find explosives. The Post attributes the death of several Royal Thai Police officers to its repeated failures to detect explosives.
Several other similar long range locator devices are being marketed in various countries, including the HEDD1 (formerly known as Sniffex Plus), marketed by Unival in Germany; Alpha 6, marketed by ComsTrac in the UK; PSD-22; and H3Tec.
In 2014, the Egyptian military presented C-FAST, a purported long-range detector of hepatitis C infection; its design was very similar to that of ADE 651.
In 2020, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) unveiled Mostaan 110, an experimental medical device developed by the Basij militia. The IRGC claimed that the device was capable of detecting COVID-19 using electromagnetic radiation emitted from the device's antenna. These claims were met with widespread criticism from Iranian and international experts alike, with many commentators noting the device's strong resemblance to the ADE 651.

"Credit report monitoring or company tracking is the monitoring of one's credit history in order to detect any suspicious activity or changes. Companies offer such service on a subscription basis, typically granting regular access to one's credit history, alerts of critical changes to one's credit history, and additional services. Credit monitoring can help detect credit related fraud and identity theft.
In the United States, whenever obtaining one's credit history, or credit monitoring, such services are typically available either as single-bureau service (with data access to only one of the 3 national credit reporting bureaus), or three-bureau service (with access to data to all three national credit reporting bureaus). It is often advisable to see data with all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) to detect identity theft. Alternatively, the reports can be obtained from Annualcreditreport website, from an account with each bureau, from credit monitoring websites or apps, and from credit repair organizations. 
In Canada, credit monitoring is provided by Equifax and TransUnion, Canada’s two major credit bureaus. In addition to a free credit report and score, Equifax have a premium credit reporting service called Equifax Complete Premier, which lets you see your updated credit report and credit score daily, with alerts and ID protection tools. Likewise, TransUnion provide a premium credit reporting service with similar features.
In the United Kingdom, the Big Three credit agencies all offer this service as well as smaller bureaus. The activities mentioned are usually the filing of latest accounts, board appointments and resignations, share capital amendments, change of company name or Registered Office address, CCJs and changes to the credit rating.
Companies providing credit monitoring will typically alert the consumer to important activity such as credit inquiries, public records, delinquencies, negative information, employment changes, new accounts and other changes to one's credit history. Most people get little benefit from paying for regular credit reporting.

"Not to be confused with Bhushan Steel, another company promoted by the same family
JSW Bhushan Power & Steel Limited (JSW BPSL) formerly known as Bhushan Power & Steel Limited is a steel company that is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of steel products. It was established in 1970. In July 2019, BPSL was allegedly involved in fraud worth ₹3805.15 crore rupees (US$535.23 million), as detected by Punjab National Bank. It is one of India's most indebted companies and appears among the 12 companies referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to a bankruptcy court for the purpose of debt resolution.


== History ==
Bhushan Power & Steel was founded in 1970, incorporated in 1973 and registered with the Registrar of Companies in Delhi. The company established its facility in Chandigarh in 1973 to manufacture Tor steel and wire rod. It has 7 manufacturing facilities in India. The company was promoted by Sanjay Singal.
Bhushan Power & Steel was acquired by JSW Steel in September 2019. JSW Steel's offer of Rs. 19,700 crores was approved by NCLT.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached assets worth Rs 4,025 crore of BPSL in October 2019 regarding the ongoing probe. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) put a stay order, and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stated in the proceedings that the ED did not have the jurisdiction to attach assets in an insolvency process. The ED is seeking a legal opinion to take the case before the Supreme Court against the order of NCLAT.


== Facility ==
The company has a 3.5 million tpa Integrated Steel and Power Plant in Sambalpur, Orissa comprising 4 DRI Kilns of 500 TPD, 100 MW Power Plant, Coal Washery, CSP Plant, Blast Furnace, Coke Oven Plant, Sinter Plant, Oxygen Plant, Steel Making and Lime & Dolomite Plant. 


== Fraud cases ==
In April 2019, the Central Bureau of Investigation accused the company of taking a loan of ₹47,000 crore (US$6 billion) from various banks including Punjab National Bank (New Delhi and Chandigarh), Oriental Bank of Commerce (Kolkata), IDBI Bank (Kolkata) and UCO Bank (Kolkata), which later turned into non-profitable assets. The case is under investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
More banks followed suit in revealing financial misdealing. On 6 July 2019, Bhushan Power and Steel Limited was accused of committing another fraud of ₹3805.15 crore rupees (US$535.23 million)  from Punjab National Bank. On 13 July 2019, Allahabad Bank disclosed that it had detected a fraud of ₹1,774.82 crore (US$210 million) by BPSL. On 16 July 2019, Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB) reported a ₹238 crore (US$28 million) fraud by BPSL.
On 26 March 2021, JSW Steel announced that it had paid ₹19,350 crore (US$2.3 billion) to the financial creditors of Bhushan Power & Steel as part of a resolution plan for acquiring the company.

"The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., is federal legislation enacted to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies. It was intended to shield consumers from the willful or negligent inclusion of erroneous data in their credit reports. To that end, the FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. It was originally passed in 1970, and is enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and private litigants.


== History ==
Before standardization of credit scoring, statements of character were integral to credit reports well into the 1960s. With credit reports containing probing details about personality, habits, and health, in the hearings on the Fair Credit Reporting Act lawmakers were troubled that individuals were helpless to clear up errors. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as originally enacted, was title VI of Pub. L. 91–508, 84 Stat. 1114, enacted October 26, 1970, entitled An Act to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require insured banks to maintain certain records, to require that certain transactions in United States currency be reported to the Department of the Treasury, and for other purposes. It was written as an amendment to add a title VI to the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Pub. L. 90–321, 82 Stat. 146, enacted June 29, 1968.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act was one of the first data privacy laws passed in the Information Age. The findings of the U.S. Congress that led to the Act and the Act's regulatory goals set the direction of information privacy in the U.S. and the world for the next sixty years. Among these innovations were the determination that there should be no secret databases to make decisions about a person's life, individuals should have a right to see and challenge the information held in such databases, and that information in such a database should expire after a reasonable amount of time.


== Consumer reports ==
Commonly referred to as credit reports, a consumer report ""contains information about your credit—and some bill repayment history—and the status of your credit accounts. This information includes how often you make your payments on time, how much credit you have, how much credit you have available, how much credit you are using, and whether a debt or bill collector is collecting on money you owe. Credit reports also can contain rental repayment information if you are a property renter. It also can contain public records such as liens, judgments, and bankruptcies that provide insight into your financial status and obligations.""


== Inaccuracies in consumer reports ==
A 2015 study released by the Federal Trade Commission found that 23% of consumers identified inaccurate information in their credit reports.  Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), an amendment to the FCRA passed in 2003, consumers are able to receive a free copy of their consumer report from each credit reporting agency once a year. The free report can be requested by telephone, mail, or through the government-authorized website: AnnualCreditReport.com.


== Civil liability ==
The FCRA regulates: 

Consumer reporting agencies;
Users of consumer reports; and,
Furnishers of consumer information.
If a consumer's rights under the FCRA are violated, then they can recover: 

Actual or statutory damages;
Attorney's fees;
Court costs; and,
Punitive damages if the violation was willful.  ""The threat of punitive damages under 1681n of the FCRA is the primary factor deterring erroneous reporting by the reporting industry.""
The statute of limitations requires consumers to file suit prior to the earlier of: two years after the violation is discovered; or five years after the violation occurred.
Consumer attorneys often take these cases on a contingency fee basis because the statute allows a consumer to recover attorney's fees from the offending party.


== Users of consumer reports ==
Users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes (including background checks) have the following responsibilities under the FCRA:

Users can only obtain consumer reports for permissible purposes under the FCRA;
Users must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports; and,
Users must identify the company that provided the report, so that the accuracy and completeness of the report may be verified or contested by the consumer.


== Employment background checks ==
Employers using consumer reports to screen job applicants or employees must follow specific procedures: 

Get your written permission;
Tell you how they want to use your credit report;
Not misuse your information;
Give you a copy of your credit report if the employer decides not to hire or fires you; and,
Give you an opportunity to dispute the information contained within your credit report before making a final adverse decision.


== Furnishers of information ==
A furnisher, as defined by the FCRA, is a company that furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies. Typically, these are creditors, with which a consumer has some sort of credit agreement (such as credit card companies, auto finance companies and mortgage banking institutions).
Other examples of information furnishers are collection agencies (third-party collectors), state or municipal courts reporting a judgment of some kind, past and present employers and bonders. Lenders have an important role to play in ensuring credit reports are accurate. Under the FCRA, creditors who furnish information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies must:

Provide complete and accurate information to the credit reporting agencies;
Investigate consumer disputes received from credit reporting agencies;
Correct, delete, or verify information within 30 days of receipt of a dispute; and,
Inform consumers about negative information which is in the process of or has already been placed on a consumer's credit report within one month.
(This notice doesn't have to be sent as a separate notice, but may be placed on a consumer's monthly statement. If sent as part as the monthly statement, it needs to be conspicuous, but need not be in bold type. Required wording developed by the US Federal Treasury Department):
Notice before negative information is reported: We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
Notice after negative information is reported: We have told a credit bureau about a late payment, missed payment or other default on your account. This information may be reflected in your credit report.


== Consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) ==
Credit reporting agencies (CRAs) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes, including employment. Credit bureaus, a type of consumer reporting agency, hold a consumer's credit report in their databases. CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA, including the following:

CRAs must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information contained within a consumer's report;
Provide a consumer with information about him or her in the agency's files and take steps to verify the accuracy of information disputed by a consumer;
If negative information is removed as a result of a consumer's dispute, it may not be reinserted without notifying the consumer in writing within five days; and,
Remove negative information seven years after the date of first delinquency (except for bankruptcies (10 years) and tax liens (seven years from the time they are paid).
The three big CRAs—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—do not interact with information furnishers directly as a result of consumer disputes. They use a system called E-Oscar. In some areas of the country, however, there are other credit bureaus.


=== Nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies ===
In addition to the three big CRAs, the FCRA also classifies dozens of other information technology companies as ""nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies"" that produce individual consumer reports used to make credit determinations. Under Section 603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the term ""nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency"" means a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis relating to:

Medical records or payments;
Residential or tenant history;
Check writing history;
Employment history; or,

Because these nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies sell consumer credit report files, they are required to provide annual disclosures of their report files to any consumer who requests disclosure. A partial list of companies classified as nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies under FCRA includes: Telecheck, ChoicePoint, Acxiom, Integrated Screening Partners, Innovis, the Insurance Services Office, Tenant Data Services, LexisNexis, Retail Equation, Central Credit, Teletrack, the MIB Group, United Health Group (Ingenix Division), and Milliman.
Although the major CRAs Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion are required by law to provide a central source website for consumers to request their reports, the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies are not required to provide a centralized online source for disclosure. The FCRA Section 612 merely requires nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies to establish a streamlined process for consumers to request consumer reports, which shall include, at a minimum, the establishment by each such agency of a toll-free telephone number for such consumer disclosure requests.

"A long-range locator is a class of fraudulent devices purported to be a type of metal detector, supposedly able to detect a variety of substances, including gold, drugs and explosives; most are said to operate on a principle of resonance with the material being detected.


== Theory of operation ==
Skeptics have examined the internals of many such devices and found those that have been examined to be incapable of operating as advertised, and have dismissed them as overpriced dowsing rods or similarly useless devices. Virtually all such devices claim to operate on a resonant frequency principle where the device is said to emit an electromagnetic signal, either through an antenna or a probe, that will respond to a specific substance such as gold, silver, or sometimes even paper money, and that the device will indicate the presence of such material by indicating a change in direction relative to the operator.
This theory of operation is not supported by scientific theory; the devices have not been shown to work in blind testing, and the resonance principle invoked has not been shown to work in laboratories (and is not consistently employed by LRL manufacturers). In addition, the Inverse-Square Law limits the effective possible signal strength of any putative LRL; moreover, not only does this attenuation apply to the supposed emissions from the LRL devices, but the return signals from the sought-after targets are further attenuated by the same constraints. Since most of these LRL devices are powered by low voltage, low current AA, AAA or 9v cells, the resultant power available for emissions is quite minuscule at best, and the return signal would suffer even greater attenuation. Examples exist of LRL devices having no internal power source at all, and these are advertised as being self-powered or powered by ambient static electricity; these are indistinguishable from dowsing rods.


== Scientific evaluation ==
Many such devices contain non-functional circuitry or naively constructed approximations of radio transmitters. A few do have functional circuitry, putting out a weak signal with a function generator or a simple timer circuit, but are still largely useless in comparison with a coil-based metal detector; others have been found to contain intentionally obfuscated or completely superfluous components (from individual components such as inductors or ribbon cables up to, in some cases, pocket calculators), often indicative of intentional fraud, incompetence, or both, by the designer. Such functioning circuitry as exists in such devices usually has no obvious way (motor, solenoid, etc.) to connect to any rotating joint in the device either, meaning the devices are often entirely dependent on the ideomotor effect to function.


== Media exposure and controversy ==
Author Tom Clancy came under fire for including the DKL Lifeguard, a long-range locator purported to be useful for detecting people, in critical passages of his novel Rainbow Six. A study by Sandia National Laboratories proved the Lifeguard to be completely useless, and other designs by the Lifeguard's creator Thomas Afilani have been shown to contain numerous dummy components with no clear function.
Accusing the manufacturers of fraud, the UK banned export of the GT 200, used by the government of Thailand, and the ADE 651, used by the government of Iraq, in January 2010.

"Vitaly Borker (born 1975 or 1976 in the former Soviet Union), known by pseudonyms Tony Russo, Stanley Bolds and Becky S, is an American felon who has twice served federal prison sentences for charges arising from how he ran his online eyeglass retail and repair sites, DecorMyEyes and  OpticsFast. Customers who complained about poor service and misfilled orders for high-end designer eyewear were insulted, harassed, threatened (sometimes physically) and sometimes made the victim of small scams. After going into online retail following a short career as a computer programmer for several Wall Street firms, Borker encountered difficult customers who, he later said, were rude, lied to him and cost him money unnecessarily. He decided to be rude and unscrupulous with them in return, and learned to his surprise that on the Internet there was no such thing as bad publicity since the many posts with links to his site on complaint sites such as Ripoff Report appeared to drive traffic to his sites due to how Google's PageRank algorithm worked at that time, putting his site higher in results for searches on brand names than even those brands' websites, and making him money.
When New York Times reporter David Segal investigated the site in 2010, Borker freely explained this business model to him when Segal came to visit his house in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay, where Borker questioned the notion that the customer is always right and said he ""like[d] the craziness."" A month later Borker was arrested by federal postal inspectors and charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and making interstate threats. He eventually pleaded guilty to fraud charges and making threats and was sentenced to prison for four years. Google and other websites whose flaws he had exploited in running DecorMyEyes also changed their practices and tightened security procedures.
Before entering prison, Borker and a friend had begun setting up another website, OpticsFast, offering not only eyeglasses for sale but repair services. After his 2015 release, he went back to his former business practices, which he mostly hid from his probation officer. Two years later, Segal reported on Borker's return in the Times, and Borker was again arrested and charged with wire and mail fraud associated with alleged harassment and abuse as operator of OpticsFast. In February 2018, he was sentenced to two years in prison for violation of his 2015 parole. Following a plea deal for the 2017 charges, he was later sentenced in 2019 to two years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, a $50,000 fine, and a $300 special assessment.
Following Borker's release in late 2020, Segal reported in the Times in 2021 that Borker appeared to have returned to selling eyeglasses online, under other personal and business names, and harassing dissatisfied customers through a new site called Eyeglassesdepot. If true, this would be a violation of a condition of his 2021 parole that he avoid any involvement in online retailing. In early 2022 he was arrested again on fraud charges related to the new site; he pleaded guilty to wire fraud a year later.


== Biography ==
Borker told New York Times reporter David Segal in 2010 that he was born in Russia and moved to the United States with his parents as a child; exactly how old he was at the time is not definitely known. After graduating from Edward R. Murrow High School in 1989 and John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 1997 he began training as a police officer, working as a cadet in the office of a unit that patrolled public housing in Brooklyn. He soon changed his mind about his career path and enrolled in a school to learn programming.
Although all classes were taught in English, all the students and teachers at the school were also all Russian immigrants, Borker recalls. Students would be taught the bare minimum that would get them hired, and then the school would help them fabricate a résumé and work history to assure that they did. ""There were a lot of schools like this,"" he said a decade later. ""They've all been shut down.""
Borker first went to work for a variety of Wall Street financial firms, including Lehman Brothers, where he worked on the systems that administered the accounts of mutual fund shareholders. Dissatisfied with the pay, Borker took a friend up on his side offer to create an online version of his eyeglass store. He continued running the online eyeglass store while he worked for Lehman, drawing lawsuits, and judgements, from luxury brands like Chanel for selling counterfeit glasses. Shortly before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the 2008 financial crisis, he left to go into online retailing full time.


== DecorMyEyes ==
The website became DecorMyEyes. Borker became disillusioned with his customers, who he says lied and cost him unnecessarily by changing their minds. ""I stopped caring"", he says, and began responding rudely to them. This led to postings on review websites disparaging him, which, to his amazement, put DecorMyEyes near the top of Google search results due to the many links to his site. Seeing the value of this perverse incentive, Borker began purposely responding to dissatisfied customers with threats and insults. It was later reported that the site had made Borker $3.2 million in one year.
Customers of DecorMyEyes posted numerous reports of receiving threats of physical violence, abuse, poor service and overcharges on websites such as ResellerRatings, where DecorMyEyes had, as of 2010, a lifetime rating of 1.39/10 from 79 reviews. One customer told authorities that after he complained someone had called his employer and accused him of dealing drugs. According to Borker, each bad review with a link boosted his site's PageRank, meaning that the site came to the top of Google's ratings for many of the products he sold. He showed the Times that his site actually came up higher than designer Christian Audigier's in a search on the designer's name. While a direct Google search for ""DecorMyEyes"" elicits the site and its many negative reviews, searching for individual products and brands does not.
The reason, cited by an anonymous Google publicist, is that the large number of links to DecorMyEyes from consumer complaint sites such as Ripoff Report cause DecorMyEyes to rank high in Google search results. In 2008 Borker made a post as ""Stanley"" on Get Satisfaction and other websites like it thanking users there for the links and the traffic they had brought him. When the website's administrators sent him an email suggesting he could work with them to work things out, he replied with a photograph of his hand with middle finger extended.
Borker said most of his customers were satisfied; he called those who were not ""psychos"". He questioned the notion that the customer is always right. ""[N]ot here, you understand?"" he told Segal. ""Why is the merchant always wrong? Can the customer ever be wrong? Is that not possible?"" He allowed that the stress might well be affecting his health, but doubted he would walk away from the site. ""I like the craziness. This works for me"", he said, likening himself to radio shock jock Howard Stern.
Borker used other websites in his business. He often sourced his glasses from sellers on eBay and told them simply to ship them to his customers' address. If the seller declined, as several did when the address had not been verified by PayPal, he left a negative review on their page, which many wanted to avoid. When sellers blocked Borker, he registered under a different name; after this was reported, eBay barred Borker from the site permanently and instituted other reforms to prevent such tactics and identify abusive buyers. Borker also maintained a store on Amazon.com under a different name, where he was much more fastidious in his dealings with customers, since that platform was willing to remove sellers if it got enough customer complaints.
Since credit card companies, in their agreements with sellers, can cancel the service if they receive enough ""chargebacks"" or buyer disputes every month, Borker told the Times he tried to make sure he avoided alienating too many. Some customers say that he threatened them to drop the dispute, sometimes suggesting he was willing to employ physical violence and emailing them pictures of their houses from Google Earth. One told Segal that her bank dropped the dispute and reinstated her charge after a woman claiming to be her called and said she no longer wished to do so.
Google responded to the Times story by writing an algorithm that ""detects the merchant from the Times article along with hundreds of other merchants that, in our opinion, provide an extremely poor user experience"" and significantly reduces their search visibility on product searches. MasterCard had dropped DecorMyEyes in 2009 due to excessive chargebacks. Borker regained access to their network by using a different bank. The company told the Times that he should not have been able to do this as he was supposed to have been placed on an internal blacklist; in the wake of the story it told Segal that it had not only put him on that list but increased its safeguards to make sure that those who were supposed to be blacklisted were. Borker responded that it was impossible to shut people down completely online. ""I'd use the name of a friend of mine"", he suggested. ""Give him 1 percent.""


== 2010 arrest and federal charges ==
A week after the Times story Borker was arrested by agents of the United States Postal Inspection Service on charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, making interstate threats and cyberstalking, and arraigned in the United States District Court in Manhattan. Bail was denied on the basis that he was a threat to the community. A search of his house turned up a stock of counterfeit eyeglasses, and fake 8mm replica guns. State charges were dismissed. After months of confinement in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Borker was freed in April 2011 upon posting $1 million bond and accepting restrictions that included accepting surveillance by a security guard in his home, at a cost to him of a thousand dollars a day.
In May 2011, Borker pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Manhattan to two counts of interstate communication of threats, one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud. In September 2012, Borker was sentenced to four years in federal prison and ordered to pay nearly $100,000 in fines and restitution. He was released four years later.


== 2017: OpticsFast ==
Before his imprisonment, Borker had a friend, Michael Voller, create a successor site, OpticsFast, to continue the business—with another friend's name on the incorporation papers—which he later reassumed control of after his release, offering this time to repair glasses as well as selling new ones. Members of Voller's family furthered the scheme by telling Borker's probation officer that he was working for their family business and fabricating documentation to support that. Borker resumed his tactics of selling customers cheap counterfeits of luxury brand eyewear and then insulting and harassing them if they complained or attempted to return or exchange the merchandise, again with the goal of driving traffic to his site through the links from online complaints, this time primarily on Yelp.
Borker is not known to have physically threatened customers during this period, although he did charge one for a mailing label he claimed to have printed after the customer decided to cancel his order, a tactic he later admitted was fraudulent when allocuting. Many communications sent by Borker under the name ""Becky S"", Judge Paul G. Gardephe noted, were the source of many of the complaints lodged against OpticsFast. ""[C]ustomers describe interactions with OpticsFast employees that appear irrational if not imbalanced"", he wrote in sentencing Borker. ""Indeed, many of the customers who filed complaints appear to have done so more because of the disturbing nature of th[ose] interactions ... rather than because of any loss they suffered from doing business with OpticsFast.""
Some customers did face offline harassment. A Southern California woman, who recognized the email she received as having come from someone involved with DecorMyEyes since it referenced an order she had made nearly a decade earlier, recalls being told on the phone by a person purporting to be a police officer that she needed to report to the police station at once as a civil harassment suit had been filed against her; she declined after asking why the police were involved if it was a civil matter. The credit card she had used to make her eyewear purchase was then used to make a series of purchases around Brooklyn.
The New York Times reported on Borker's apparent return, noting that OpticsFast had been active while he was in prison. Search engine expert Doug Pierce, consulted by the newspaper, found the code and HTML running the OpticsFast page to have been substantially similar to DecorMyEyes until 2016, when Borker was released. Both domains had the same owner, but since the sites had been active while Borker was imprisoned the Times could not say for certain that he was involved in the new site.
In May 2017, a month after the story ran, Borker was arrested again and charged with wire and mail fraud associated with alleged harassment and abuse as operator of OpticsFast. Voller, also originally indicted, turned state's evidence against Borker and had most charges dropped; he was sentenced to time served in late 2020. Borker has sued him and others in state court alleging breach of contract.
Joon H. Kim, acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York said that ""Borker's shameless brand of alleged abuse cannot be tolerated, and we are committed to protecting consumers from becoming victims of such criminal behavior"". Borker's lawyer stated his client would ""plead not guilty and defend himself against the charges"", which carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.


=== Plea and sentencing ===
In February 2018, Borker was sentenced to two years for violating parole after his release in 2015. The terms of his parole forbade him from lying to his parole officers, which he had done when he had repeatedly denied he had started another online eyewear retail site.
A month later, Borker pleaded guilty to wire  and mail fraud charges in exchange for a reduced sentence. CNBC devoted an episode of American Greed to Borker in June. In April 2019, he was sentenced to two years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, a $50,000 fine, and a $300 special assessment. He was released from prison in November 2020.


== 2021–22: Eyeglassesdepot ==
In 2021, the Times reported that Borker may have again returned to selling eyeglasses online and harassing dissatisfied customers, this time through a site named Eyeglassesdepot. Customers reported similar behavior, such as threats, insults and online doxxing, including not only their credit card numbers but the cards' security codes, when they complained or tried to return merchandise, and attempts to intimidate them into paying for printed mailing labels after they changed their mind. They said the company's representative identified themselves as ""Arsenio"".
This time, Trustpilot hosted many of the negative reviews. The owner of Eyeglassesdepot seemed to more genuinely fear the consequences of bad reviews there. He followed up one customer's complaints about his behavior with a post claiming it was a fake review posted by a competing site, along with the complainant's home address and cell phone number. He also threatened to post multiple fake positive reviews for every negative one.
Trustpilot management investigated after receiving complaints, and found almost half of the positive reviews of Eyeglassesdepot were fake. It removed them and sent Eyeglassesdepot an email asking that it cease and desist from further such behavior. ""Yeah whatever"" read the reply.
Pierce believes that Eyeglassesdepot and OpticsFast, which look very similar and share common third-party tags, have the same owner. Pierce concluded, ""Whoever created Eyeglassesdepot simply cloned OpticsFast, perhaps in the interest of saving time and money, and then made a few cosmetic changes"". Pierce allowed that that individual may not have been Vitaly Borker, ""But who else would steal the code from a website as notorious as OpticsFast?""
Borker's attorney denied that his client was Arsenio. If Borker were to be involved in any way with Eyeglassesdepot, that by itself would be enough to send him back to prison, since the terms of his most recent parole forbid him from any involvement whatsoever with online retail.
In February 2022, prosecutors announced that Borker had been arrested again, on one count each of mail fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, the latter stemming from his use of two other people's names while running eyeglassesdepot. The Times noted that while he had apparently started it while still in a halfway house after his previous conviction, this time he seemed less audacious, content to merely sell used or counterfeit eyewear as new and genuine while not paying refunds, and provoking, threatening and abusing unhappy customers to lesser degree than he had previously. In January 2023 he pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to 30 months in prison.


== Personal life ==
At the time of his first arrest, Borker was married and had a daughter born in 2008.
In 2019, during sentencing in the OpticsFast case, Gardephe noted that Borker had been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Better Business Bureau report of DecorMyEyes Archived 2012-01-11 at the Wayback Machine"
"Cramming is a form of fraud in which small charges are added to a bill by a third party without the subscriber's consent, approval, authorization or disclosure. These may be disguised as a tax, some other common fee or a bogus service, and may be several dollars or even just a few cents. The crammer's intent is that the subscriber will overlook and ultimately pay these small charges without challenging their legitimacy or inquiring further.
According to the U.S. National Association of Attorneys General, cramming was the 4th most common consumer complaint of 2007 in the United States.


== Types ==
There are various forms of cramming.


=== Phone cramming ===

Phone cramming is the practice of placing unauthorized charges on a telecommunication subscriber's home or mobile telephone bill.
Cramming is most common in the US, where the breakup of the Bell System left subscribers with different vendors for local and long-distance service. LEC billing consolidated charges from multiple vendors on one bill, but opened an opportunity (which does not exist elsewhere) for fraudulent vendors to add their own charges to the consolidated bills. This is not the same as telephone slamming, where an existing vendor is replaced with a rival without the client's informed consent.
In the UK all the UK mobile operators have a third party direct to bill scheme (chargetomobile 'payforit') controlled by the Payforit Scheme Rules which prevent unauthorised charging.
In the USA an effort to prevent instances of cramming, some members of the third party billing industry have implemented screening and monitoring measures to identify and eliminate crammers.  Some companies offer consumer protection websites to help consumers better understand their phone bill and detect cramming as soon as it occurs.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates that cramming has impacted tens of millions of American households.


=== Web cramming ===
Web cramming involves billing consumers for a web page they did not even know they had.

This is most often accomplished when criminals develop new web pages for small businesses and non-profit groups for little or no expense.  While advertising their service as free, these criminals actually engage in unauthorized phone charges on their victim's accounts.  The most common scam involves ""rebate checks.""   These checks, when cashed, transfer the customer's Internet service provider, placing monthly service charges on their telephone bill.  This is made possible because telecommunications companies provide the service of being able to collect bills for companies that perform a service over the telephone.


=== Preacquired accounts ===
Another is ""preacquired account telemarketing fraud"", cramming of unauthorized charges by telemarketers who have bought or obtained consumer account information prior to the telemarketing call, sometimes from the consumer's own bank.


== Fighting cramming ==
Phone companies like Verizon respond by removing cramming charges from a consumer's bill upon request, and will cease business with the company that crams. Verizon, at the customer's request, will put a Cramming Block on the customer's account, that prevents third parties from adding charges.
All the UK mobile operators have a third-party direct-to-bill scheme (chargetomobile 'payforit') controlled by the Payforit Scheme Rules which prevent unauthorised charges. 


== Notable cases ==
In 2005, Gambino Family Soldier Richard Martino and Captain Salvatore LoCascio admitted to running a cramming operation.
Following a Federal Communications Commission investigation, in October 2010, Verizon announced that it would refund up to $50 million to its customers to offset cramming charges.
In October 2014, AT&T Mobility agreed to pay $105 million in refunds and penalties for cramming for premium-rated short messages; the agreement was the largest such settlement in history; AT&T was  ""accused of keeping at least 35% of the fees, as well as obscuring the charges on bills and preventing customers from securing full refunds.""

"The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB; formerly Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation/GBFI) – informally known as the Fraud Squad – is a specialised division of Ireland's national police force, the Garda Síochána, that investigates economic crimes. The Bureau operates as part of the Garda Special Crime Operations branch and works alongside other sections of the force, as well as the external Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), an agency tasked with investigating white-collar crime. The Economic Crime Bureau is responsible for the investigation of serious financial fraud and corruption. It was established in April 1996 and is based at Harcourt Square, Dublin 2. The GNECB is headed by an officer of Detective Chief Superintendent rank, who reports to the Assistant Commissioner of Special Crime Operations.
The Economic Crime Bureau investigates serious and complex cases of commercial fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, cheque and payment card fraud, counterfeit currency, advance fee fraud, bribery and corruption and breaches of the Companies Acts and competition law. As an investigative unit, all members are experienced investigators, and include trained financial, legal and specialists, such as forensic accountants.
The GNECB is divided into a number of operational units with a Detective Superintendent or Detective Inspector in charge of each specialist area:

Assessment Unit
Serious Economic Crime Investigation Unit
Anti-Corruption Unit
Money Laundering Investigation Unit (MLIU)
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
Payment Crime and Counterfeit Currency Investigation Unit
Corporate Enforcement Unit (GNECB detectives are seconded to the Director of Corporate Enforcement)
Until 1 September 2016, the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) was housed within the National Economic Crime Bureau, including its time as the Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU). However, it was subsequently constituted as a separate Bureau within the Special Crime Operations section of the Garda Síochána, with oversight by the Detective Chief Superintendent of the GNECB. The Bureau is headed by a Detective Superintendent and is responsible for the investigation of cybercrime and cyber-related crime, and for the provision of a computer forensic service to the Garda Síochána.
The Economic Crime Bureau focuses on major and complex economic crimes based on the following criteria: monetary loss, investigations involving a significant international dimension, investigations concerning widespread public concern, investigations requiring specialised knowledge and investigations involving complex issues of law or procedure. The Bureau's responsibility includes the gathering of information and financial intelligence (FININT) for the force and Irish government, extending to terrorism financing, and proactively detecting and preventing fraud through sting operations.
As part of European Union (EU) counter-terrorism initiatives on tackling Islamic extremism and jihadism, the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau monitors suspects in Ireland and outside the jurisdiction using the internet to distribute propaganda such as videos linked to terror groups, especially the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. It was established in 2016.
The GNECB works particularly closely with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Revenue Commissioners, Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and internally with the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI) relating to investigations concerning issues such as monetary fraud, suspicious transaction reports (STR), racketeering, embezzlement, corruption and bribery. The GNECB is a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units.

"ChongLuaDao (Vietnamese: Chống Lừa Đảo, lit. 'Scam Fighters') is a Vietnamese non-profit cybersecurity organization that helps clients verify the legitimacy of websites and block access to dangerous ones to keep them safe while using the internet. This non-profit project was started by a group of Vietnamese computer security specialists, including Hieu Minh Ngo, a former hacker who is now a technical expert for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Le Phuoc Hoa, Nguyen Hoang Thang, and Nguyen Hung.


== Beginning ==
After serving his time in U.S. federal prison for stealing persons' personally identifiable information, hacker Hieu Minh Ngo (also known as HieuPC) left for Vietnam in August 2020. Hieu is considered ""one of the most prolific identity thieves ever to grace a federal prison"". Returning to Vietnam in the wake of a surge in cybercrime, he has teamed up with a number of other professionals in information security to launch a nonprofit project aimed at preventing cybercrime, alerting users to bad websites, and protecting them from malicious content. Hieu claims that Scam Fighter is a project he has cherished during his time in the US. These are all purportedly part of HieuPC's ""rehabilitation"" efforts, along with several other community initiatives.
A group of programming and information security specialists composed the core team of the project, including Nguyen Manh Luat, Nguyen Hung, Le Phuoc Hoa, Pham Tien Manh,  and Hieu Minh Ngo. The project team has so far included roughly 30 people. Additionally, Duong Ngoc Thai, a former Google engineer and leader of the security and application encryption team, serves as the project's confidential data security counsel for its customers.


== Launch and development ==
The non-profit ChongLuaDao officially started operations on December 27, 2020. The ""ChongLuaDao"" project, including the website and the plug-in extension, is formally launched by February 2021, with server infrastructure operated by Vietnix Hosting. The plug-in extension has more than 3,500 downloads, more than 70,000 views, and has added more than 1,000 scam websites to the denylist as a result of more than 1,400 user reports in just one day after introduction. They also teamed up with the Anti-Phishing Working Group to share data on cyberthreats. As of October of the same year, the average monthly traffic to the website of ChongLuaDao to test the reliability of another website was about 35,000. They continued to release apps for Android and deploy application development for IOS after the plug-in extension's success on web browser platforms. The application was created using machine learning techniques and often updated datasets that were derived from community contributions. Their chatbot debuted on Facebook Messenger in September. Through this, Facebook users may instantly assess the trustworthiness and security of a website on their phone while chatting live with automated software. Hieu Minh Ngo announced the establishment of the ChongLuaDao Social Enterprise Limited Liability Company (also known as the ChongLuaDao Company) on November 24, 2021, of which he served as CEO.
During the final few months of 2022, Vietnamese users are often deceived by phony applications and websites that steal personal information. Reports of fraudulent banking domains are regularly sent to the ChongLuaDao Project. Their main message was to call for community engagement to protect oneself and those around them. By the start of 2023, ChongLuaDaol had attracted more than 300,000 users to join the community through Telegram, Facebook, and web browser extensions, helping more than 11,000 victims of cyber fraud. In its more than two years of operation, the project has received collaboration and support from significant institutions and tech companies like PhishTank, Meta, and Viettel Cyber Security. A database of 15,000 malicious URLs, including websites that steal personal information, are malicious, or contain malware, has been made available to users. The project discovered more than 3,200 fake websites taking assets and collecting user data in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the app has 50,000 regular users, and its widgets and API threat feeds have been included in many other worldwide products, such as those from Kaspersky Anti-Virus software and Cisco (OpenDNS), Viettel, and CyRadar, among other security and cybersecurity firms.
Throughout its operating duration, the project team regularly issued warnings regarding the situation and often occurring fraud, in addition to offering remedies and help to fraud victims. Vietnam had a spike in ransomware assaults and deepfake videos around May 2023. The ChongLuaDao team has provided assistance in a number of counterfeit incidents where users have lost money. They not only alert and assist fraud victims, but they also offer a phone line for free legal assistance. As of now, ChongLuaDao is not only a source of data but also one of the websites, a tool that is frequently offered to readers to warn and report on harmful websites, as the Vietnamese press issues warnings about cyber fraud.
In September and October 2023, ChongLuaDao conducted two seminars to increase public understanding of information security and fraud forms. This is a unique workshop series for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. By the end of December of the same year, ChongLuaDao's items had been recognized at the Vietnamese Talent Awards (Vietnamese: Nhân tài Đất Việt) in the product category ""Contribution to the Community"". This prize was given to the initiative shortly before its third anniversary. On January 5, 2024, the third anniversary of the ChongLuaDao project's founding was celebrated in Ho Chi Minh City. Many members from governmental organizations, including the National Cyber Security Center, the Vietnam Blockchain Association, and the Vietnam Information Security Association, as well as major Vietnamese technology businesses, including FPT, VNG, and CMC Cyber Security, attended the event. By the time of the event, ChongLuaDao's member communities had reached 500,000 members on the Facebook platform and 25,000 members in the Telegram group, thereby helping ChongLuaDao detect and handle more than 20,000 malicious websites.


== Cooperation ==
In August 2022, the API of the ChongLuaDao project was incorporated into the social media platform Twitter, one of the top five most-visited websites. As a result, users cannot publish URLs that are denylisted, and Twitter will also notify users when they input these links in tweets and direct messages. ChongLuaDao formally inked an agreement with the Law Library (Vietnamese: Thư viện Pháp luật) in October of the same year to collaborate in the implementation of assistance programs to safeguard users from the danger of cyber fraud. The Global Anti-Scam Alliance's research on worldwide internet fraud uses data from two initiatives, one of which is ChongLuaDao. And now, ChongLuaDao is currently a GASA supporting member. In December, the Vietnamese government gave their products the Make in Vietnam prize, making them one of the top 10 items for the digital society.
Today's most popular browsers, including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Cốc Cốc, Firefox, and Brave, all support the ChongLuaDao plugin extension. Microsoft and Opera systems proceeded to stop users from accessing the fraudulent site after receiving data from ChongLuaDao. On March 29, 2023, ChongLuaDao and Top CV worked together to analyze businesses and recruitment data in order to identify, stop, and alert users to various types of recruiting team fraud, safeguard the interests of employees, and other legitimate businesses. A strategic data sharing cooperation between Chong Lua Dao and AI SPERA, the creator of the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) search engine Criminal IP, was launched on June 7, 2023. Together, they work to improve cybersecurity efforts throughout the world and make the internet a safer place for both people and companies.
At the end of August 2023, the Authority of Information Security of Vietnam, the FIDO Alliance, and VinCSS co-hosted the first FIDO APAC Summit in Vietnam. With the involvement of several corporate executives and specialists in the sectors of technology and cybersecurity, the conference was held over the course of three days in Nha Trang under the topic ""Connecting for a Safer Digital Future: Passwordless Authentication in the APAC Region."" At the event, ChongLuaDao and network services company VinCSS signed a partnership agreement with the goal of engaging in a number of joint activities together, including education to increase community awareness, the deployment of technology solutions for identification and security authentication, and assisting Vietnam in bolstering its digital space defense capabilities and reducing the risk of becoming a target of international cybercriminals.
In November of that same year, the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) released a report about scams in Asian nations, including Vietnam. The authors of this report are ChongLuaDao, Gogolook, and GASA. The report's contents indicate that ChongLuaDao is a significant partner in the data collection process about scams in Vietnam. Also around this time, ChongLuaDao and GASA collaborated to issue a report about scams in Vietnam in 2023. The data provided in the two reports piqued the interest of the Vietnamese media as soon as it was revealed, and continued to be discussed following ChongLuaDao's celebration of its third anniversary of project planning. During the celebration, ChongLuaDao also revealed that the project's API has been directly included in Google Chrome, one of the most widely used web browsers available today, with the intention of providing users with automatic protection from ChongLuaDao data sets without requiring any further work on their part.

"Big Motor (BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd. (Japanese: 株式会社ビッグモーター, Hepburn: Kabushiki gaisha Biggumōtā)) was a Japanese automotive retailer. Formerly the largest used car dealer in Japan, in 2023 the company was hit by a series of scandals and allegations of widespread, systematic insurance fraud. The allegations led to the resignation of its founder and president, Hiroyuki Kaneshige, Japan's Financial Services Agency revoking the company's insurance agent registration, and ultimately the sale of the company to Itochu general trading company, which rebranded the company into WECARS. The allegations also implicated insurance company Sompo Japan, which was accused of purposely ignoring the fraud to preserve its business relationship with Big Motor. The Big Motor scandal has prompted a greater reassessment of Japan's insurance industry and investigations into the largest Japanese insurance firms.


== History ==
Big Motor was founded in 1976 by Hiroyuki Kaneshige as Kaneshige Auto Center in Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture. In 1980, the company was renamed to Big Motor, and began opening stores elsewhere in Yamaguchi Prefecture, including Shimonoseki in 1984, Hōfu in 1985, and Kudamatsu in 1995. In 1998, the company opened its first dealership outside of Yamaguchi Prefecture in Utazu, in neighboring Kagawa Prefecture. Nevertheless, from 1997 to 2011 the company gradually downsized, reducing capital and dissolving subsidiaries.  
Despite the downsizing in the previous decade, from 2012 to 2022 Big Motor experienced rapid growth, increasing sales eightfold and became the biggest used car dealership in Japan, capturing 15% of the market. The company's website boasted that the company was ""number one in Japan in terms of the number of cars purchased for six consecutive years"". The company also moved its headquarters from Jōtō-ku, Osaka, to the affluent Roppongi Hills, Tokyo, in 2015. 
In 2023, the company had over 300 locations and 6,000 employees. The company offered a wide variety of car-related services, including car sales and leasing, vehicle inspection, vehicle insurance and repairs. The company employed celebrity branding, employing actors such as Ryuta Sato, Masahiko Nishimura and Nao Omori in commercials.


=== Sale and rebranding ===

As a result of Big Motor's scandals and controversies which broke in July 2023, the company experienced administrative sanctions and an evaporation of consumer trust. Big Motor's sales plummeted to only about 10–20% pre-scandal levels, and the company began actively seeking a buyer, signing an agreement with Itochu general trading company on 17 November 2023. On 1 May 2024, Big Motor was sold to Itochu for ¥60 billion and the majority of its assets spun off into a new company, WECARS Co., with the remainder of Big Motor renamed to Balm Co. and tasked with paying off outstanding liabilities and loans. Itochu appointed Shinjiro Tanaka, an executive with experience at revitalizing companies as CEO, and Akiko Ito, former head of the Consumer Affairs Agency as a director to ensure accountability in the company. At the time of the rebranding, sales had only recovered to about 40% pre-scandal levels.


== Scandals and controversies ==
In 2023, Big Motor was the subject of a series of scandals, allegations and criminal investigations, chief of which was accusations of systematic and widespread insurance fraud, but also included purposefully poisoning municipal trees, predatory sales tactics, and a toxic corporate culture. Ultimately, the result of the scandal resulted in various sanctions and the sale of the company.


=== Insurance fraud ===
In June 2022, a whistleblower reported to the three largest insurance firms in Japan – Sompo Japan, Mitsui Sumitomo, and Tokio Marine Nichido – that Big Motor was making fraudulent insurance claims. At the request of the three insurance firms, in January 2023 Big Motor conducted an internal investigation, which concluded that the claims were mistakenly made. Although Sompo Japan accepted the findings and resumed business with Big Motor, Mitsui Sumitomo and Tokio Marine Nichido decided to conduct their own investigation with a panel of third-party lawyers and experts.
On 18 July 2023, the panel released their findings, accusing Big Motor of ""systematically damaging automobiles and unnecessarily replacing parts"" during repair work at their dealerships, as part of a culture of widespread insurance fraud. The panel, which surveyed 382 Big Motor employees said that nearly 30% admitted to deliberately shoddy repair work, with a further 60% saying that their supervisors directly ordered them to do so. The report alleged that Big Motor supervisors threatened repair shop employees with demotion unless they netted at least ¥140,000 in profits for each vehicle serviced, motivating employees to damage cars to net higher insurance claims. 
Employees allegedly used screwdrivers and sandpaper to scratch cars — and hit cars with socks stuffed with golf balls. In total, the report found that out of 8,427 Big Motor insurance claims since November 2022, at least 1,275 or 15% of them were fraudulent, with the average excess amount being ¥39,000. Reports emerged that Big Motor employees also concluded numerous fictional insurance contracts. After further investigation, the number of fraudulent claims was pegged at 65,000, or 30% of claims made over the past five to eight years.
Big Motor's internal investigation was later found to have been substantially false, with the results of eight out of the twelve individual cases investigated doctored by order of Big Motor executives.


=== Tree killing ===
Concurrent to the investigation into the insurance fraud, allegations emerged of Big Motor employees purposefully poisoning roadside trees and other vegetation with herbicide or simply cutting them down, with the Japanese police receiving over 50 damage reports to roadside trees. In one case, 17 trees which covered up advertising for the local Big Motor outlet in Ōta, Gunma Prefecture, were found dead, with traces of herbicide detected in the soil. In another case, 24 purple azaleas, valued at ¥308,200, were uprooted in front of a Big Motor outlet in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture.
As a part of the investigation into the tree-killing, Big Motor headquarters and nine outlets were raided by Tokyo police in September 2023. Later, it emerged that Big Motor vice president and son of founder Hiroyuki Kaneshige, Koichi Kaneshige, personally led monthly ""environmental inspections"", which financially penalized employees for not cutting down trees as well as not maintaining ""fanatical hygiene"". On 4 March 2024, 13 former Big Motor employees including former Vice President Koichi Kaneshige were indicted for property destruction related to the killing of the trees.


=== Other controversies ===
In 2016, it was reported that Big Motor financially penalized sales managers who did not meet an aggressive insurance sales target of ¥250,000. When confronted about this, Big Motor acknowledged the report, but claimed that penalties were voluntary and not part of company policy.
In July 2023, during the investigation into the insurance fraud scandal, it was revealed through leaked messages that President Hiroyuki Kaneshige and his son, Vice President Koichi Kaneshige, regularly berated employees, calling one an ""idiot"" and another a ""piece of junk"". In another exchange, Koichi Kaneshige, in a conversation ostensibly about sales, typed the word ""death penalty"" (死刑) eighteen times, which was the subject of widespread ridicule by the Japanese public and was one of the winners of the Internet Buzzword Award. In the aftermath of the scandals, Hiroyuki and Koichi Kaneshige attempted to delete most of these messages.


=== Aftermath ===
On 18 July 2023, immediately after the publication of the report implicating Big Motor for systematic insurance fraud, Big Motor released a statement pledging to pay back the insurers and Transport Minister Tetsuo Saito announced an investigation into the company. On 25 July, Big Motor founder and president Hiroyuki Kaneshige resigned in a press conference, claiming that he and top executives had no knowledge of the fraud but admitted that he had neglected to create healthy corporate governance. On 17 August 2023, Big Motor's request to refinance ¥9 billion owed to leading Japanese banks was rejected in the wake of the scandal, throwing the finances of the company into turmoil.
On 19 September 2023, Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) raided Big Motor's offices in Tama, Tokyo. On 24 October, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism ordered Big Motor to suspend repair services in 34 locations, and continued investigations into the remainder of locations. On 30 November, the FSA rescinded Big Motor's insurance agent registration, preventing them from selling insurance to customers.
During the scandal, suspicion also fell on insurer Sompo Japan for accepting Big Motor's falsified internal investigation and resuming business with them, despite the other large insurers rejecting the internal investigation and conducting their own. During their 19 September raid on Big Motor's corporate offices, the Financial Services Agency simultaneously raided Sompo Japan's offices in Shinjuku, Tokyo. On 11 October 2023, the FSA released their report, alleging that Sompo Japan was aware that the internal investigation had been falsified, but had declined to act as to preserve their business relationship with Big Motor. It later emerged that Sompo had also staffed Big Motor with about 40 of its own employees, and that Big Motor had prioritized selling Sompo Japan insurance to its customers. In response to the allegations and an order from the Financial Services Agency to improve managerial practices, Sompo Japan's CEO Kengo Sakurada and President Giichi Shirakawa announced their resignations on 26 January 2024.
The scandal also prompted greater scrutiny in both the Japanese automotive retailing and insurance industries. On 3 October 2023, a whistleblower alleged that car retailer G-After employed similar insurance fraud tactics to Big Motor. Furthermore, the FSA's investigation of Sompo Japan revealed allegations that Sompo Japan, Mitsui Sumitomo, Tokio Marine Nichido and other leading Japanese insurers were price-fixing risk-sharing joint contracts in an unrelated scandal. The effects of the Big Motor scandal has been linked by The Diplomat to the Unification Church scandal after the assassination of Shinzo Abe and the allegations of bribery for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics as part of a wider ""crisis of confidence"" in Japanese society.
As of July 2024, insurers have succeeded in adjusting 1,700 fraudulent claims out of an estimated 65,000 from the company inheriting Big Motor's liabilities, Balm Co., which has refused further adjustments of claims pending a court order.

"The Office of Inspector General for the Department of State (OIG) is an independent office within the U.S. Department of State with a primary responsibility to prevent and detect waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. OIG inspects more than 270 embassies, diplomatic posts, and international broadcasting installations throughout the world to determine whether policy goals are being achieved and whether the interests of the United States are being represented and advanced effectively.
Additionally, OIG performs specialized security inspections and audits in support of the department's mission to provide effective protection to the personnel, facilities, and sensitive information. OIG also audits operations and activities of the department and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to ensure that they are as effective, efficient, and economical as possible. Finally, OIG investigates instances of fraud, waste, and mismanagement that may constitute either criminal wrongdoing or violation of Department and USAGM regulations. OIG is a member of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.


== Mandate ==
The Inspector General Act of 1978 mandated many federal departments to create Offices of Inspector General. The Act imposed a requirement on inspectors general to report both to their agency heads and to Congress. The Inspector General of the Department of State was one of the last federal OIGs to be created.
The Department of State established an internal inspection office in 1906 (S/IG) – however, this function transferred to the OIG under the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, section 4861, specifically directed ""the Secretary of State to proceed immediately to establish an Office of Inspector General of the Department of State not later than October 1, 1986…"" This section includes duties and responsibilities authorized, and limitations on the appointment of an inspector general.


== Offices ==


=== Office of Audits ===
The Office of Audits has a leading role in helping the U.S. Department of State and USAGM improve management; strengthen integrity and accountability; and ensure the most efficient, effective, and economical use of resources.

The Counsel to the Inspector General reports to the Inspector General, and is independent from the State Department's Legal Adviser and USAGM's General Counsel.


=== Office of Evaluations and Special Projects ===
The Office of Evaluations and Special Projects was established in 2014 to strengthen OIG's oversight of the Department and USAGM, and to improve OIG's capabilities to meet statutory requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012. ESP will fulfill OIG's whistleblower protection duties by educating Department and USAGM employees and contractors on the protections from retaliation for disclosing fraud, waste, or abuse.

== Vacancy during Clinton tenure ==
Throughout the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, there was no permanent inspector general at the State Department.  Moreover, President Barack Obama did not nominate anyone for that position while Clinton was Secretary. Although the office remained running under Harold W. Geisel—a State Department employee—the ""Government Accountability Office, lawmakers from both parties and nonprofit groups"" criticized the delay in identifying a nominee, and called for the position to be filled by an inspector independent of the State Department.

"Anti-phishing software  consists of computer programs that attempt to identify phishing content contained in websites, e-mail, or other forms used to accessing data (usually from the internet) and block the content, usually with a warning to the user (and often an option to view the content regardless). It is often integrated with web browsers and email clients as a toolbar that displays the real domain name for the website the viewer is visiting, in an attempt to prevent fraudulent websites from masquerading as other legitimate websites.
Most popular web browsers comes with built-in anti-phishing and anti-malware protection services, but almost none of the alternate web browsers have such protections.
Password managers can also be used to help defend against phishing, as can some mutual authentication techniques.

=== Email security ===
According to Gartner, ""email security refers collectively to the prediction, prevention, detection and response framework used to provide attack protection and access protection for email."" Email security solution may be : Email security spans gateways, email systems, user behavior, content security, and various supporting processes, services and adjacent security architecture.

An independent study  conducted by Carnegie Mellon University CyLab titled ""Phinding Phish: An Evaluation of Anti-Phishing Toolbars"" and released November 13, 2006 tested the ability of ten anti-phishing solutions to block or warn about known phishing sites and not block or warn about legitimate sites (not exhibit false-positives), as well as the usability of each solution. Of the solutions tested, Netcraft Toolbar, EarthLink ScamBlocker and SpoofGuard were able to correctly identify over 75% of the sites tested, with Netcraft Toolbar receiving the highest score without incorrectly identifying legitimate sites as phishing. Severe problems were, however, discovered using SpoofGuard, and it incorrectly identified 38% of the tested legitimate sites as phishing, leading to the conclusion that ""such inaccuracies might nullify the benefits SpoofGuard offers in identifying phishing sites."" Google Safe Browsing (which has since been built into Firefox) and Internet Explorer both performed well, but when testing the ability to detect fresh phishes Netcraft Toolbar scored as high as 96%, while Google Safe Browsing scored as low as 0%. The testing was performed using phishing data obtained from Anti-Phishing Working Group, PhishTank, and an unnamed email filtering vendor.
Another study, conducted by SmartWare for Mozilla and released November 14, 2006, concluded that the anti-phishing filter in Firefox was more effective than Internet Explorer by over 10%. The results of this study have been questioned by critics, noting that the testing data was sourced from PhishTank, which itself is an anti-phishing provider. The study only compared Internet Explorer and Firefox, leaving out (among others) Netcraft Toolbar and the Opera browser, both of which use data from PhishTank in their anti-phishing solutions. This has led to speculations that, with the limited testing data, both Opera and Netcraft Toolbar would have got a perfect score had they been part of the study.
While these two reports were released only one day apart, Asa Dotzler, Director of Community Development at Mozilla, has responded to the criticism of the Mozilla-commissioned report by saying, ""so you're agreeing that the most recent legitimate data puts Firefox ahead. Good enough for me.""
Since these studies were conducted, both Microsoft and Opera Software have started licensing Netcraft's anti-phishing data, bringing the effectiveness of their browser's built-in anti-phishing on par with Netcraft Toolbar.

"Telemarketing fraud is fraudulent selling conducted over the telephone. The term is also used for telephone fraud not involving selling.
Telemarketing fraud is one of the most persuasive deceptions identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Telemarketing fraud often involves some sort of victim compliance whether it involves the victim initiating contact with the perpetrator or voluntarily providing their private information to the offender; thus, fraud victims may experience feelings of shame and embarrassment that may prevent them from reporting their victimization.
Older people are disproportionately targeted by fraudulent telemarketers and make up 80% of victims affected by telemarketing scams alone. Older people may be targeted more because the scammer assumes they may be more trusting, too polite to hang up, or have a nest egg. Many older people have money to invest and are in need of profit. Also, they are less likely to report the fraud because they don't believe that consumer complaints would be solved.


== Types of fraud ==
Advance fee fraud – They will typically require upfront payments in exchange for goods and services. This is also a popular technique used in lottery and student scholarships scams. Once the target has provided their personal information, the fraudsters will ask them to pay various fees – for example: taxes, legal fees, banking fees, etc. – so that they can release their non-existent winnings.
Pyramid schemes – Work by recruiting “members” to invest into a scheme. Most of the money is made by recruiting new members and a prime characteristic of the scam is the product is of little value. The people at the bottom of the pyramid pay the people at the top. Inevitably they will run out of new recruits and the scheme will collapse. Some individuals may profit from pyramid schemes, but the vast majority of those who join later on in the scheme will not.
Credit card fraud – Fraudsters will call with promises to repair their credit ratings, provide credit options or credit facilities, credit cards with zero or very low interest, or instant and unlimited loans without credit checks or security. Such offers, if followed up, tend to come at a considerable cost to victims in terms of high interest rates or exorbitant fees. It is common for scammers to target people who have bad credit and are therefore more susceptible to take the offer in hopes to pay off debts or to increase their credit rating.
Overpayment fraud – One of the most popular scams making the rounds. A generous overpayment is made to the victim typically using a fake cheque. This can vary in goods but is popular among online auctions or classifieds. But before the cheque has been cleared by a bank and the victim discovers that the cheque has bounced, the scammer will request to have the difference refunded  Usually through an online banking transfer, pre-loaded money card, or a wire transfer such as Western Union. Therefore, victims lose the money they send along with the item itself.
Charity fraud – Telemarketers claiming to represent charities call asking the target for a donation. Fake charities try to take advantage of people's generosity and compassion for others in need. Scammers will steal the money by posing as a genuine charity; they may try to use recent events, such as natural disasters, to make their phony pleas for donations sound more believable. These scammers use aggressive high pressure techniques made to make the victim feel guilty or selfish if they do not want to donate.
Cramming – Small charges that are secretly inserted into customers' credit card bills for services they did not order, buried so deep in credit card bills that many do not notice, usually with fake fees by vague financial services. Sometimes a one-time charge for entertainment services will be crammed onto phone bills. Other times it may be a recurring monthly charge. Cramming of recurring charges falls into two general categories: club memberships, such as psychic clubs, personal clubs, or travel clubs; and telecommunications products or service programs, such as voice mail, paging, and calling cards.
Summer jobs fraud – Much like an advance fee fraud, these scams are aimed at teenagers or young adults looking for work over the summer period. Telemarketers seek out the victims by scanning student job searches. The telemarketer will then claim the victim has been singled out and specially selected to be hired for a particular job. Before they can start work, however, they are told that they have to pay various fees to cover training, materials and insurance. When they eventually realize the job is a scam, it is already too late; they have lost the money they paid for in fees as well as the time it would take to find a new job.
Office supply scam – A very common scam where a telemarketer will target business managers responsible for purchasing office supplies, falsely representing their identity and the cost of office supplies – the most popular being toner. The caller might mislead a company's employees into thinking that an order for office supplies has already been placed, either by an existing or former colleague, and that they are calling to chase up a signature for the order form to help them keep complete records. The company is then invoiced for unwanted, and overpriced, stationery and office supplies.
Magazine subscriptions scam - Scammers call victims with an intriguing offer and that for a small payment they can get a yearly subscription to their favorite magazine, even though they have no affiliation with the magazine's publisher. When victims agree, the scammers will send random magazines with grossly inflated prices. Another way they extract money is by falsely telling callers it is time to renew their magazine subscriptions in an attempt to get their credit or bank account information.
Harassing/Stalking


== Telemarketing fraud tools ==
Caller I.D. spoofing - Allows the caller to present any number they want to put up on the screen including existing numbers while keeping the real number they call from private. Caller I.D. spoofing is a low cost option to help ensure anonymity. The same devices can also change voices to sound like a male or female.
Robocalls - Technology has made it cheap and easy for robocallers to make calls from anywhere in the world. Most of these calls originate overseas, many in boiler rooms in India, and they are surprisingly effective. Robocalls have been used for legitimate campaigning and public opinion polling, but have also been used for voter suppression, false endorsements, and negative campaigning that borders on fraud. The federal regulatory regime currently excludes political robocalls from most telemarketing regulations. Presidential campaigns and national interest groups have accidentally violated state laws in trying to communicate with voters by using robocalls.
Crawler devices - A majority of fraudulent calls originate from Nigerian phone scammers, who claim $12.7 billion a year off phone scams. Some callers have to make up to 1000 calls per day. To help with speeding things up, they will sometimes use crawler devices which is computerized to go through every area code calling each number. If the caller does not reach, they mark the lead as ""no answer"" and the system programs it so they get called again a few days later. If the company does not have a large lead pool, they may get called as soon as 12 hours later. As with email spammers, they know that a certain proportion of their hits will score.
False identity – Fraudulent telemarketers use aliases to cover their tracks and prevent detection from the law. Some fraudulent telemarketers are deliberately located in other countries, as it is more difficult for law enforcement agencies to pursue them. Typically, scammers will use common western names in a bid to reassure callers they are calling from the same country.


== Scam Identification and blocking software ==
Scam Likely is a term used for scam call identification, the term was originally coined by T-Mobile for the scam ID technology created by First Orion.
First Orion's scam blocking technology uses a combination of known bad actors, AI powered blocking including neighborhood spoofing and unusual calling pattern. 
Scam Identification is a feature of the T-Mobile and Metro carrier network which can be controlled by the app Scam Shield, customer care or dialing the short code #664 to turn on or off scam blocking.
There are a number of phone apps which try to identify, screen, send to voicemail or otherwise deter telemarketing calls with most major carriers providing some level of free scam call screening.""Call Blocking"". Federal Trade Commission. Retrieved 2021-08-04.
Additionally both iOS  and Android operating systems offer scam screening options. 
In addition phone carriers may provide caller authentication using STIR/SHAKEN a caller authentication protocol designed to stop caller id spoofing by exchanging tokens between cellular carriers.


== Popular scams ==
Grandparent scam

A telephone call is made to an elderly person with a family member who is supposedly in some kind of trouble, usually claiming to be a grandson or granddaughter. These calls are often placed late at night or early in the morning when most people are not thinking as clearly. Callers assume that their targets have grandchildren and will usually have several other people in on the scam, such as a bail bondsman, the arresting police officer, a lawyer, a doctor at a hospital, or some other person. The first voice on the phone is usually by the scammer pretending to be the grandchild sounding upset and typically stating that there are only a few moments to talk. The caller may say that they have a cold if the victim does not recognize their voice. Their story generally follows a familiar line: they were traveling in another country with a friend, and after a car accident or legal infraction, they are in jail and need bail money wired to a Western Union account as soon as possible for their quick release. The caller does not want anyone told about the incident, especially not family. Before the victim can ask too much about the situation the phony child will hand the phone over to the accomplice who will then request money to be transferred to release the grandchild from jail. While this is commonly called the grandparent scam, criminals may also claim to be a family friend, a niece or nephew, or another family member.
Microsoft scam

A telephone call is made saying typically that virus activity has been detected on the victim's computer; the overseas caller then states they are from Microsoft or a Microsoft certified technician. Callers assume that the victim has a computer running a Microsoft Windows operating system (users of other operating systems, such as Linux, are a minority and are likely to be technically knowledgeable). They will get the computer owner to give the caller remote access using a genuine networking service or website like ammyy.com or TeamViewer. They will use the ‘Event Viewer’ tool on the computer to highlight the Red-X Errors and Yellow Warnings which are supposedly signs of an infection, when in fact these are normal and harmless logs They also encrypt the owner's password database, preventing access to the computer without the scammers' password, essentially locking the victim out of their own computer and ensuring that they themselves will be paid. At this stage the caller then has complete control over the computer, and can display further alarming displays, as well as installing malware. The cold caller will then offer to remove the viruses and malicious malware (some of which they have installed themselves) and install security software and provide an ongoing support service costing up to $500. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reported a huge crackdown on tech support scams and ordered a halt to several alleged tech support scams.

"Rogue security software is a form of malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. It is a form of scareware that manipulates users through fear, and a form of ransomware. Rogue security software has been a serious security threat in desktop computing since 2008. An early example that gained infamy was SpySheriff and its clones, such as Nava Shield.
With the rise of cyber-criminals and a black market with thousands of organizations and individuals trading exploits, malware, virtual assets, and credentials, rogue security software has become one of the most lucrative criminal operations.


== Propagation ==
Rogue security software mainly relies on social engineering (fraud) to defeat the security built into modern operating system and browser software and install itself onto victims' computers.  A website may, for example, display a fictitious warning dialog stating that someone's machine is infected with a computer virus, and encourage them through manipulation to install or purchase scareware in the belief that they are purchasing genuine antivirus software.
Most have a Trojan horse component, which users are misled into installing.  The Trojan may be disguised as:

A browser plug-in or extension (typically toolbar)
An image, screensaver or archive file attached to an e-mail message
Multimedia codec required to play a certain video clip
Software shared on peer-to-peer networks
A free online malware-scanning service
Some rogue security software, however, propagate onto users' computers as drive-by downloads which exploit security vulnerabilities in web browsers, PDF viewers, or email clients to install themselves without any manual interaction.
More recently, malware distributors have been utilizing SEO poisoning techniques by pushing infected URLs to the top of search engine results about recent news events. People looking for articles on such events on a search engine may encounter results that, upon being clicked, are instead redirected through a series of sites before arriving at a landing page that says that their machine is infected and pushes a download to a ""trial"" of the rogue program.  A 2010 study by Google found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising.
Cold-calling has also become a vector for distribution of this type of malware, with callers often claiming to be from ""Microsoft Support"" or another legitimate organization.


== Common infection vectors ==


=== Black Hat SEO ===
Black Hat search engine optimization (SEO) is a technique used to trick search engines into displaying malicious URLs in search results. The malicious webpages are filled with popular keywords in order to achieve a higher ranking in the search results. When the end user searches the web, one of these infected webpages is returned. Usually the most popular keywords from services such as Google Trends are used to generate webpages via PHP scripts placed on the compromised website. These PHP scripts will then monitor for search engine crawlers and feed them with specially crafted webpages that are then listed in the search results. Then, when the user searches for their keyword or images and clicks on the malicious link, they will be redirected to the Rogue security software payload.


=== Malvertising ===
Most websites usually employ third-party services for advertising on their webpages. If one of these advertising services is compromised, they may end up inadvertently infecting all of the websites using their service by advertising rogue security software.


=== Spam campaigns ===
Spam messages that include malicious attachments, links to binaries and drive-by download sites are another common mechanism for distributing rogue security software. Spam emails are often sent with content associated with typical day-to-day activities such as parcel deliveries, or taxation documents, designed to entice users to click on links or run attachments. When users succumb to these kinds of social engineering tricks they are quickly infected either directly via the attachment, or indirectly via a malicious website. This is known as a drive-by download. Usually in drive-by download attacks the malware is installed on the victim's machine without any interaction or awareness and occurs simply by visiting the website.


== Operation ==
Once installed, the rogue security software may then attempt to entice the user into purchasing a service or additional software by:

Alerting the user with the fake or simulated detection of malware or pornography.
Displaying an animation simulating a system crash and reboot.
Selectively disabling parts of the system to prevent the user from uninstalling the malware.  Some may also prevent anti-malware programs from running, disable automatic system software updates and block access to websites of anti-malware vendors.
Installing actual malware onto the computer, then alerting the user after ""detecting"" them.  This method is less common as the malware is likely to be detected by legitimate anti-malware programs.
Altering system registries and security settings, then ""alerting"" the user.
Developers of rogue security software may also entice people into purchasing their product by claiming to give a portion of their sales to a charitable cause. The rogue Green antivirus, for example, claims to donate $2 to an environmental care program for each sale made.
Some rogue security software overlaps in function with scareware by also:

Presenting offers to fix urgent performance problems or perform essential maintenance on the computer.
Scaring the user by presenting authentic-looking pop-up warnings and security alerts, which may mimic actual system notices.  These are intended to use the trust that the user has in vendors of legitimate security software.
Sanction by the FTC and the increasing effectiveness of anti-malware tools since 2006 have made it difficult for spyware and adware distribution networks—already complex to begin with—to operate profitably.  Malware vendors have turned instead to the simpler, more profitable business model of rogue security software, which is targeted directly at users of desktop computers.
Rogue security software is often distributed through highly lucrative affiliate networks, in which affiliates supplied with Trojan kits for the software are paid a fee for every successful installation, and a commission from any resulting purchases.  The affiliates then become responsible for setting up infection vectors and distribution infrastructure for the software.  An investigation by security researchers into the Antivirus XP 2008 rogue security software found just such an affiliate network, in which members were grossing commissions upwards of $USD150,000 over 10 days, from tens of thousands of successful installations.
Despite its use of old-fashioned and somewhat unsophisticated techniques, rogue security software has become a significant security threat, due to the size of the impacted populations, the number of different variants that have been unleashed (over 250), and the profits that have been made for cyber-criminals (over $300,000 a month).


== Countermeasures ==


=== Private efforts ===
Law enforcement and legislation in all countries are slow to react to the appearance of rogue security software. In contrast, several private initiatives providing discussion forums and lists of dangerous products were founded soon after the appearance of the first rogue security software. Some reputable vendors, such as Kaspersky, also began to provide lists of rogue security software. In 2005, the Anti-Spyware Coalition was founded, a coalition of anti-spyware software companies, academics, and consumer groups.
Many of the private initiatives were initially informal discussions on general Internet forums, but some were started or even entirely carried out by individual people. The perhaps most famous and extensive one is the Spyware Warrior list of rogue/suspect antispyware products and websites by Eric Howes, which has however not been updated since May 2007. The website recommends checking the following websites for new rogue anti-spyware programs, most of which are not really new and are ""simply re-branded clones and knockoffs of the same rogue applications that have been around for years.""


=== Government efforts ===
In December 2008, the US District Court for Maryland—at the request of the FTC—issued a restraining order against Innovative Marketing Inc, a Kyiv-based firm producing and marketing the rogue security software products WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner, ErrorSafe, and XP Antivirus.  The company and its US-based web host, ByteHosting Internet Hosting Services LLC, had their assets frozen, were barred from using domain names associated with those products and any further advertisement or false representation.
Law enforcement has also exerted pressure on banks to shut down merchant gateways involved in processing rogue security software purchases.  In some cases, the high volume of credit card chargebacks generated by such purchases has also prompted processors to take action against rogue security software vendors.

"Charles William Ingram (born 6 August 1963) is a British fraudster and a former major in the British Army who gained fame for his appearance on the ITV television game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Across two episodes recorded in September 2001, Ingram correctly answered fifteen questions to win the show's maximum prize of £1 million, becoming the third recorded contestant ever to do so; however, he was denied the winnings due to suspicion of cheating.
Following a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court, Ingram was convicted on a single count of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. He was subsequently convicted of an unrelated offence involving insurance fraud in 2003 and ordered to resign his commission as a major by the Army Board.


== Early life ==
Charles William Ingram was born on 6 August 1963 in Shardlow, Derbyshire, the son of John Ingram, a retired Royal Air Force (RAF) Wing Commander, and his wife, Susan, a theatre set designer. His father's Wellington bomber, operating with 103 Squadron from RAF Elsham Wolds, had been shot down in late September 1941; he was taken as a prisoner of war while two of his crew were killed.
Ingram's parents divorced when he was young, and he spent most of his education years boarding privately at Oswestry School in Oswestry, Shropshire. There he was a member of the Combined Cadet Force and completed the Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award. He went on to obtain a BSc in civil engineering from Kingston University.


== Military career ==
In 1987, Ingram trained for the British Army at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1990 and major in 1995. In 1999, Ingram was sent to Banja Luka in Bosnia for six months on United Nations peacekeeping duties. He graduated from Cranfield University with a master's degree in corporate management in August 2000. He was ordered by the Army Board via letter to resign his commission on 20 August 2003 and to give up his rank of major. Whether he was dishonourably discharged remains unclear.


== Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? scandal ==

On 9 September 2001 Ingram became a contestant on the ITV game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, following his wife, Diana, and her brother Adrian Pollock, each of whom had won £32,000 as a previous contestant. To prepare, Ingram practised for about twenty minutes per day on a homemade ""Fastest Finger First"" machine. Ingram got into the ""hot seat"", but used two of his three lifelines early, ending the day at £4,000 and with only the 50/50 lifeline remaining. The production team did not expect him to proceed much further, but he ended up making it all the way to the £1 million prize on the second day of recording. 
Throughout Ingram's run on the second day of recording, the production team were increasingly suspicious of him. He was taking brazen risks and playing the game in an unusual manner. One of the questions Ingram got during the run was ""Who had a hit UK album with Born to Do It released in 2000?"" After using his 50/50 the two remaining answers were A1 (what he believed the answer to be) and Craig David, whom he said he had never heard of. After nearly locking in A1 as his final answer, he backed down and later said ""80% of the time I'm wrong when I guess, so you know what—I'll go Craig David."" He then locked in the correct answer of Craig David. At the penultimate question, worth £500,000, Ingram was asked: ""Baron Haussmann is best known for his planning of which city?"" Amongst the options were Berlin and Paris, the former of which he immediately assumed as the right answer due to his belief that Haussmann is a German name. However, after some time he said, ""there's a possibility that it's Paris"" before eventually deciding to lock in Paris as his final answer. This got Ingram to the £1 million question—""A number one followed by one hundred zeros is known by what name?""—to which he thought the answer was nanomole and initially said he did not know what a googol is. However, he eventually decided to lock in ""googol"" as his final answer which won him the £1 million prize. Rod Taylor, an executive producer, later said in a documentary about the scandal, ""It became obvious that he wasn't under the pressure that he should have been, somehow... He should have been very, very careful, and very certain. And he certainly wasn't [either of those].""
After Ingram had won the £1 million, producers were suspicious enough that a search was performed on him. His hair, clothing, and shoes were searched; however, the method of cheating used meant that nothing incriminating was found on his person. After he left the set, the show's production company, Celador, were tipped off by the show's producers of the assumed irregularities within the episode, and they suspended the jackpot payout to investigate the matter. At the same time, the show's presenter, Chris Tarrant, overheard that the Ingrams had been arguing, despite Charles's success, moments before Tarrant joined them in their dressing-room for champagne; another member of the production team also noted a similar thought about the couple's behaviour. While reviewing the recording, the production team made a connection between Ingram's answers and coughs coming from one of the waiting contestants, Tecwen Whittock; for one question, the coughing came from Ingram's wife Diana whilst she was in the audience. Based on this evidence, all three were accused of cheating, and the matter was handed over to the police to investigate further. Whittock and the Ingrams were eventually charged with ""procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception"". 


=== Trial ===
Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three and a half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of their offences on 7 April 2003. Both of the Ingrams and Whittock were given prison sentences, suspended for two years—the Ingrams were sentenced to eighteen months; Whittock was sentenced to twelve months—and each fined £15,000 and ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial's judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs, which left them repaying a total of £115,000.
On 19 August 2003, the Army Board ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major after sixteen years of service, but stated that this would not affect his pension entitlements.
On 19 May 2004, the Court of Appeal denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs. On 5 October, the House of Lords denied Ingram leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On 20 October, the original trial judge reduced Ingram's defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana's defence costs order to £5,000. Ingram's defence costs were later further reduced to £5,000 on appeal.
In 2006, the journalist Jon Ronson, who covered the case at the time for The Guardian, wrote that he believed the Ingrams might be innocent. Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word ""cough"" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. James Plaskett, a chess grandmaster who had appeared in the Fastest Finger First round several times before winning £250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock or others had simply coughed involuntarily upon hearing the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option and quickly followed it with a smothered ""no"". However, Plaskett, who had sat in the same seat, argued that someone might have said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other contestants have been known to whisper ""no"".


==== Recorded evidence ====
In court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on Millionaire was ""unrepresentative of what I heard"", and he continues to assert that it was ""unfairly manipulated"". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds, including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and ""for the benefit of the jury"" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither ""listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing"". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were ""significant"". The prosecution asserted that these ""significant"" coughs were by Whittock when the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.


==== Testimony of Larry Whitehurst ====
Larry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced that coughing had helped Ingram.


==== Testimony of Tecwen Whittock ====
Whittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life, insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answers. During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself earned the right to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared. Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras. Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to the twelfth question, regarding the artist who painted The Ambassadors, in a hand-written general knowledge book at Whittock's home.
Davies, the floor manager on Millionaire, said that as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording he decided to find out who was responsible. ""The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three"", he said. ""He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to cough""— and while Davies described this as ""bizarre"", Whittock remarked during the trial, ""You do not cough into someone's face"".
During the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a ""serial quiz show loser"" because he had been eliminated in round one of Channel 4's Fifteen to One, had also failed on ITV's The People Versus and had been able to win only an atlas on his appearance on ITV's Sale of the Century. He had also done poorly on Beat the Bong, although he did reach the semi-final stage of the BBC radio quiz show Brain of Britain.


== After Millionaire ==


=== Books ===
Since leaving the Army, Ingram has written two novels: The Network (2006) and Deep Siege (2007).


=== TV appearances ===
Following his appearance on Millionaire, Ingram has appeared on various other television shows, including Channel 4's The Games, the BBC's The Weakest Link, and Channel 4's Wife Swap, featuring alongside his wife in the latter two.
On The Weakest Link, Anne Robinson jokingly referred to the ""dashing young major with a throat infection"", regarding his Millionaire appearance. A question was also posed concerning, ""In classical music what 'C' is the act of throat clearing which members of the audience are asked to try to avoid?"", the answer being ""coughing"".
Ingram also narrowly lost to Paul Daniels on the short-lived Channel 5 game show 19 Keys in November 2003.


=== Insurance fraud case ===
In late 2003, Ingram and his wife were charged with further fraud offences. On 28 October, Ingram was found guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and of a second charge of deception, having attempted to claim on an insurance policy after an alleged burglary at his home. Ingram had failed to tell Direct Line Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001. However, a spokesman for Wiltshire Constabulary, David Taylor, said those offences were ""not fraud"". The court was told that Ingram had been a ""habitual claimant"" with Norwich Union after suffering ""unfortunate"" losses of private possessions.
Christopher Parker, prosecuting, said Ingram switched insurers to Zurich Insurance Group in 1997, after Norwich Union reduced a burglary claim from £19,000 to £9,000, and in 2000 switched again to Direct Line. ""He has been ineluctably dishonest,"" Parker said. ""He went to Direct Line and didn't make a disclosure about his claims history, because he knew he wouldn't have been insured. It might not have started off as the most monstrous piece of villainy but these things tend to snowball and it all came to a sticky end when he claimed for £30,000."" Staff at Direct Line were already ""suspicious"" about Ingram's £30,000 burglary claim but decided to investigate only after reading newspaper coverage about his questionable win on Millionaire.
Ingram was given a conditional discharge on the charge of fraudulently claiming £30,000 on insurance. The judge told Ingram he took into account ""the punishment [Ingram had] brought upon [himself] and [his] dire financial state"" and rejected an alternative option of community service after Ingram told a probation officer he feared other criminals would bully him.


== In popular culture ==
A book covering the case, Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major, by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett, was published in January 2015.
Quiz, a play written by James Graham that re-examines the events and subsequent conviction of the Ingrams and Whittock, opened at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, on 3 November 2017, running until 9 December 2017. The play transferred to the West End, playing at the Noël Coward Theatre from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018. In 2019, Graham adapted his play into a serial drama for ITV that was broadcast in April 2020 in three parts. Ingram was portrayed in the series by Matthew Macfadyen. The series also aired on AMC and BBC America in the United States in June 2020 and on RTÉ One in Ireland in February 2021.


== Personal life ==
Ingram met his wife, Diana, while she was training to be a teacher at Barry College in Wales. The two became engaged during his first posting with the Royal Engineers in Germany. They were married in November 1989 and have three children.
In 2010, Ingram lost three toes on his left foot in an accident involving a lawnmower.

"Spy pixels or tracker pixels are hyperlinks to remote image files in HTML email messages that have the effect of spying on the person reading the email if the image is downloaded. They are commonly embedded in the HTML of an email as small, imperceptible, transparent graphic files. Spy pixels are commonly used in marketing, and there are several countermeasures in place that aim to block email tracking pixels. However, there are few regulations in place that effectively guard against email tracking approaches.


== History ==
Networked email was pioneered in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson and has made it much more convenient to send and receive messages as opposed to traditional postal mail. In 2020, there were 4 billion email users worldwide and approximately 306 billion emails sent and received daily. The email sender, however, still has to wait for a reply email from the recipient in order to confirm that their message was delivered. There are some situations where the recipient doesn't respond to the sender even when they have read the email, which is why the email tracking method emerged. Most email services do not provide indicators as to whether an email was read, so third-party applications and plug-ins have provided the convenience of email tracking. The most common method is the email tracking beacon or spy pixel.
Spy pixels were described as ""endemic"" in February 2021. The ""Hey"" email service, contacted by BBC News, estimated that it blocked spy pixels in about 600,000 out of 1,000,000 messages per day.


== Mechanism ==
HTML email messages typically contain hyperlinks to online resources. Common software used by a recipient of email may, by default, automatically download remote image files from hyperlinks, without asking the user for confirmation. After downloading an image file, the software displays the image to the recipient. A spy pixel is an image file that is deliberately made small, often of a single pixel and of a colour that makes it ""impossible to spot with the naked eye even if you know where to look."" Any email user can be reached via email tracking due to the open nature of email.
The tracking process begins when a sender inserts an image tag, represented as <img>, into an HTML-based email. The image tag is linked to a tracking object stored on the server of the sender through a reference Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Once the mail client is opened, the recipient receives the email through a process whereby the mail user agent (MUA) synchronizes updates from the recipient's message transfer agent (MTA) with the local mail repository. When the recipient opens the email, the mail client requests the file that is referenced by the image tag. As a result, the web server where the file is stored logs the request and returns the image to the recipient. In order to track individual behavior, the tracking object or reference URL has to contain a tag that is unique to each email recipient. Oftentimes, the hash of the recipient's email is used. In contrast, IP address and device information collected from non-tracking images does not reveal specific users' email addresses.
When a single email is sent to multiple recipients, the tracking report will normally show the number of emails that have been opened but not the specific recipients who have done so.


=== Email tracking vs. web tracking ===
Web tracking and email tracking employ similar mechanisms, such as the usage of tracking images or cookies. Email tracking makes it much easier to trace back to any individual without consent, as email addresses can often reveal an individual's affiliation to a particular organization, browsing history, online social media profile, and other PII. This can lead to cross-tracking across devices, where third-party services link devices that share common attributes such as IP addresses, local networks, or login information. Although this may be more challenging with web tracking, more advanced web trackers have data collection features, like the Meta Pixel's advanced matching feature, that allows people to be identified by submitting an email address or other PII on a form page.


== Usage ==


=== Personal use ===
Individuals and business owners may want to use email tracking for a variety of reasons, such as lead generation, event invitations, promotions, newsletters, one-click polls, and teacher-parent communications. They can use services like Yet Another Mail Merge (YAMM), a Google Sheets add-on, to create and send personalized mail merge campaigns from Gmail. The sender has the option to enable the tracker and see email open rates, clicks, replies, and bounces. According to YAMM's website: ""YAMM embeds a tiny, invisible tracking image (a single-pixel gif, sometimes called a web beacon) within the content of each message. When the recipient opens the message, the tracking image is scanned, referenced and recorded in our system.""


=== Marketing ===
Tracking the behavior of users through mediums like email newsletters and other forms of marketing communication is a competitive advantage in online marketing. In fact, it is so valuable that there are companies that sell online user data or offer email tracking as a service, such as Bananatag, Mailtrack.io, and Yet Another Mail Merge.This is because by learning more about the user based on their clicking histories and demographics, websites and companies can tailor messages to each user. The more information on the individual-level preferences of a user, the better. Customized communications in marketing can then result in heightened customer loyalty, lock-in, and satisfaction, which translates to increased cash flows and profitability. Using data to map out the competitive landscape can also help companies derive a competitive strategy and gain a competitive advantage. However, adverse effects from behavioral marketing can include discrimination, including price discrimination.


=== Malicious emails ===
Some emails contain malicious content or attachments, and email tracking is used to detect how fast these viruses or malicious programs can spread. At the same time, generally, the deliverability of tracked emails is reduced up to 85%, as the firewalls of company servers embed algorithms to filter out emails with suspicious contents.


=== Research ===
Web tracking and tracking software are used by researchers who need to gather data for their research, especially in information seeking studies. In fact, tracking technologies can be used for good, offering valuable information for the development of websites, portals, and digital libraries. It can also be used to improve user interfaces, search engines, menu items, navigational features, online help, and intelligent software agents, information architecture, content description, metadata, and more. These finds can be useful in marketing and e-commerce and may be important to people like library and information professionals, educators, and database designers.


== Spying effect ==
The spying effect is that, without the email recipient choosing to do so, the result of the automatic download is to report to the sender of the email: if and when an email is read, when (and how many times) it is read, the IP address and other identity details of the computer or smartphone used to read the email, and from the latter, the geographical location of the recipient. This information provides insights into users' email reading behaviors, office and travel times, as well as details about their environment. By doing a reverse lookup of an IP address, the log entry can provide information on which organizations a user is affiliated with. For example, a board member of a major technology company was caught forwarding confidential information when an email log entry, IP address, and location information were examined simultaneously. Additionally, if spammers send emails to random email addresses, they can identify active accounts in this manner.
There exist many companies that offer email tracking services to senders. According to a study done by three researchers at Princeton University, about 30% of the emails they analyzed leaked recipients' email addresses to third parties via methods like embedded pixels, the majority of them intentionally. 85% of emails in their corpus of 12,618 gathered using a web crawler contained embedded third-party content, with 70% categorized as trackers. Top third-party domains include ""doubleclick.net"", ""mathtag.com"", ""dotomi.com"", and ""adnxs.com"", and the top organizations that collect leaked email addresses include The Acxiom, Conversant Media, LiveIntent, Neustar, and Litmus Software. Reloading an email increases the chance of the recipient's information being leaked to third parties. The study also found that tracking protection was helpful: it reduces the number of email addresses leaked by 87%.
A separate study found that 24.7% of 44,449 emails analyzed were embedded with at least one tracking beacon. Emails categorized as travel, news/media, and health had the highest prevalence of tracking, with 57.8%, 51.9%, and 43.4% containing at least one tracking beacon respectively. On the other hand, emails categorized as email client, social networking, and education have the least tracking, with 0.6%, 1.6%, and 3.8% containing at least one tracking beacon respectively. Through a survey, the authors also found that 52.1% of participants who checked email quite often were unaware that they could be tracked from simply opening an email. 86% of participants consider email tracking as a serious privacy threat.
According to poll results from Zogby International, 80% of consumers are either ""somewhat"" or ""very"" concerned about online tracking. Consumers who perceive a lack of business or governmental regulation will try to regain power through a variety of responses, such as fabricating personal information, using privacy-enhancing technologies, and refusing to purchase. At the same time, some argue that people's perceptions about privacy have changed with the times. For example, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, said, ""People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.""
Cambridge Analytica used a third-party app called “thisisyourdigitallife” to collect information from over 50 million Facebook users. Access to users' emails can expose them to data leaks. Four researchers from the University of Iowa and the Lahore University of Management Sciences designed and deployed CanaryTrap, which identifies data misuse by third-party apps on online social networks. It does this by linking a honeytoken to a user’s social media page and then watches for unrecognized usage. Specifically, the authors shared email addresses as honeytokens and watched for any unrecognized use of those email addresses. After performing an experiment on 1,024 Facebook pages, the authors discover multiple counts of data misuse. 422 unrecognized emails were received on honeytokens shared with 20 Facebook apps. Within those 422 emails, 76 were categorized as malicious or spam. Furthermore, third-party trackers can be considered as “adversaries” to Internet users because the use of HTTP cookies, Flash cookies, and DOM storage breaks data confidentiality between the users and the websites they interact with.
Overall, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Qualcomm found that many users don't see tracking as black and white. Many want control over tracking and think that it has its benefits, but don't know how to control tracking or distrust current tools. Out of 35 participants in the study, fourteen saw tracking as conditionally positive, eight saw it as generally neutral, nine saw it as generally negative, and the remaining four had mixed feelings. Twelve participants felt resigned to tracking.


== Countermeasures ==
Countermeasures include using a plain text email client, disabling automatic download of images, or, if reading email using a browser, installing an add-on or browser extension.
The process of email-tracking does not require cookies, which makes it difficult to block without affecting user experience. For example, disabling automatic download of images is easy to implement; however, the trade-off is that it often results in a loss of information, incorrect formatting, a decline in user experience, and incomprehension or confusion.
Three Princeton University researchers who analyzed 16 email clients found that none of the existing setups completely protects users from the threats of email tracking. Blocking extensions such as uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and Ghostery can filter tracking requests.
Four other researchers aimed to detect trackers by focusing on analyzing the behavior of invisible pixels. After crawling 84,658 web pages from 8,744 domains, they found that invisible pixels are present on more than 94.51% of domains and make up 35.66% of all third-party images. Filter lists such as EasyList, EasyPrivacy, and Disconnect are popular ways to detect tracking; they detect known tracking and advertising requests by keeping a ""blacklist."" However, they miss around 30% of the trackers that the researchers detected. Moreover, when all three filter lists were combined, 379,245 requests from 8,744 domains still tracked users on 68.70% of websites.
Recent research has focused on using machine learning to develop anti-tracking software for end-users.
Analyzing mail flows and aggregate statistical data can help protect user accounts by detecting abnormal email behavior such as viral propagation of malicious email attachments, spam emails, and email policy violations.
Privacy tools can have usability flaws which makes it difficult for users to make informed and meaningful decisions. For example, participants in a study thought that they had installed configured a tool successfully when they had not. Additionally, the rise of ad-blockers and similar privacy tools have led to the emergence of anti ad-blockers, which seek out ad-blockers and try to disable them with various methods, in an escalating ad-blocker arms race.


== Privacy regulations and policies ==
There are few regulation initiatives that exist to protect users from email tracking. The help pages of many email clients, such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Thunderbird may mislead users into thinking that privacy risks associated with email tracking are limited by stating that the threat is restricted to the email sender receiving recipients' information rather than third-parties also being able to access that information.


=== United States ===
The U.S. currently does not have comprehensive privacy rights in place. The Fourth Amendment, which guarantees ""the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects. against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated"" does not explicitly apply to private companies and individuals. California's state constitution, however, grants individuals explicit privacy rights from both government and private action. There are regulations that target specific sectors, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 directed towards the financial services sector, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 for the healthcare sector, and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor framework which assists US companies' compliance with the EU's Directive on Data Protection.


=== European Union ===
The European Union passed the Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) in 1995 which requires member states to comply with certain privacy protection laws, focused on protecting the consumer. The directive forbids the exchange of data between EU member countries and countries that are not in accordance with the directive. Personal data can only be collected in certain circumstances and must be disclosed to individuals whose information is being collected. Additionally, PII can only be kept for as long as it is used for its original purpose.
The EU first introduction a set of regulations on tracking technologies in 2002. In 2009, the EU Directive mandated that websites ask for consent before using any type of profiling technology, such as cookies. As a result, most European websites implemented a ""cookie bar."" However, four researchers at the Polytechnic University of Turin performed an experiment on 35,000 websites using a tool called CookieCheck and found that 49% of those websites do not follow the EU cookie directive and installed profiling cookies before the user gave consent. In conclusion, the authors argue that the EU regulatory framework has been ineffective in enforcing rules and has not done much in helping reduce users’ exposure to tracking technologies.

== Independence ==
The inspector general is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. An inspector general may only be removed by the president, who must notify the Congress of the reasons for such a removal. The inspector general has independent authority within the department to initiate and conduct audits, investigations, and special assessments in areas involving the programs and operations of the department.
The inspector general has authority to “have direct and prompt access” to the secretary of defense “for any purpose pertaining to the performance of the functions and responsibilities” of the inspector general (IG Act 6.a.6). The inspector general has the authority to “select, appoint, and employ such officers and employees as may be necessary” (IG Act 6.a.7), “directly contract for program services” (IG Act 6.a.9) and “maintain legal counsel who report directly to the Inspector General” (IG Act 3.g).
The secretary of defense may prohibit the inspector general from initiating, carrying out, or completing an audit or investigation, or from issuing a subpoena if the secretary determines that each prohibition is necessary to preserve the national security interests of the United States. Exercise of such power requires notification to Congress within thirty days to include a statement of the reasons for the exercise of such power (IG Act 8).


== Oversight planning ==
DoD IG receives requests from Congress, the department and the public. In addition to these sources, DoD IG plans projects based on areas critical to the management challenges of the department, which are published in the Department of Defense Agency Financial Report.

"In geomarketing and internet marketing, geotargeting is the method of delivering different content to visitors based on their geolocation. This includes country, region/state, city, metro code/zip code, organization, IP address, ISP, or other criteria. A common usage of geotargeting is found in online advertising, as well as internet television with sites such as iPlayer and Hulu. In these circumstances, content is often restricted to users geolocated in specific countries; this approach serves as a means of implementing digital rights management. Use of proxy servers and virtual private networks may give a false location.


== Geographical information provided by the visitor ==
In geotargeting with geolocation software, the geolocation is based on geographical and other personal information that is provided by the visitor or others.


=== Content by choice ===
Some websites, for example FedEx and UPS, utilize geotargeting by giving users the choice to select their country location. The user is then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection. 


=== Automated different content ===
In internet marketing and geomarketing, the delivery of different content based on the geographical geolocation and other personal information is automated. A good example is the Ace Hardware website at www.acehardware.com. The company utilizes geolocation software to power the “My Local Ace” section of its website. Based on a site visitor's location, the website's online locator service can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address. Different offers may be presented depending on local conditions, e.g. weather, local competitors, local trends, etc.


== IP spidering ==
The automated discovery of user person/organisation/city-level geolocation information based on IP addresses by traceroute, pings, and a combination of other tools and methods is far more advanced.
It is dependent on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IPv4 addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, especially in light of the fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved, and changed due to routers being moved, enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary. Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of Web spidering.


== IP delivery in SEO ==

Websites utilize IP delivery for search engine optimization (SEO) in a method called cloaking. SEOs maintain a list of IP addresses that are known to be servers owned by a search engine and used to run their crawler applications (spiders). The visitor's IP address is compared to the list, and if it is determined to be a search engine spider, it is presented with different web page content from human visitors. Cloaking is against most search engines' webmaster guidelines.
Although search engine guidelines imply that any type of cloaking is bad, there are instances when the practice may be legitimate. The subject is very controversial and continues to be debated by SEO experts.
""Cloaking"" via IP delivery is different from cloaking via ""user agent"". While IP address spoofing is harder and more reliable than user-agent spoofing, it is also harder to keep the list of IP addresses used by search engines for their crawlers up-to-date. An outdated list of active crawler IP addresses enables the search engines to detect cloaking and may result in a removal of the site from the search engine's index.


== Common uses ==
Content Localization: Webmasters who want to serve local content on a global domain.
Copyright owners and delivery networks restrict streams based on the geographical information.
Pay per click advertisement to have ads appear only to users who live in selected locations.
Display advertisement where banner or other multimedia ads are displayed based on the visitor's location.
The use of connection speed data correlated to IP address to tailor content.
Online analytics identify live the correlation of city-level geography, connection speed data, and certain demographic data to IP addresses.
Enhanced performance networks provide superior customer targeting to advertisers.
Fraud prevention identifies suspicious payment transactions live by correlations between IP address and additional information (billing records, email header).
City advertising by advertising on web sites with extensive content related to particular cities. Such websites can connect large city audiences with products/services for sale in those cities. Surfers searching for information about particular cities find adverts on such web sites as a result of city name related searches rather than product/service keyword searches. In this way businesses, e.g. shops, restaurants, can advertise and reach out to consumers located in the real-world localities of their product/service offerings.
Content based on local time using IP geolocation.
Use of a content distribution network to serve data from a nearby server.
Website Personalization, where website content is changed and replaced based on visitor location.
One-to-one or household IP targeting surfaces display advertisements to individual buildings or homes.
Content / Ad verification - changing IPs for content compliance or ad verification.

"An Internet bot, web robot, robot, or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) on the Internet, usually with the intent to imitate human activity, such as messaging, on a large scale. An Internet bot plays the client role in a client–server model whereas the server role is usually played by web servers. Internet bots are able to perform simple and repetitive tasks much faster than a person could ever do. The most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.
Efforts by web servers to restrict bots vary. Some servers have a robots.txt file that contains the rules governing bot behavior on that server. Any bot that does not follow the rules could, in theory, be denied access to or be removed from the affected website. If the posted text file has no associated program/software/app, then adhering to the rules is entirely voluntary. There would be no way to enforce the rules or to ensure that a bot's creator or implementer reads or acknowledges the robots.txt file. Some bots are ""good"", e.g. search engine spiders, while others are used to launch malicious attacks on political campaigns, for example.


== IM and IRC ==
Some bots communicate with users of Internet-based services, via instant messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or other web interfaces such as Facebook bots and Twitter bots. These chatbots may allow people to ask questions in plain English and then formulate a response. Such bots can often handle reporting weather, postal code information, sports scores, currency or other unit conversions, etc. Others are used for entertainment, such as SmarterChild on AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.
Additional roles of an IRC bot may be to listen on a conversation channel, and to comment on certain phrases uttered by the participants (based on pattern matching). This is sometimes used as a help service for new users or to censor profanity.


== Social bots ==

Social bots are sets of algorithms that take on the duties of repetitive sets of instructions in order to establish a service or connection among social networking users. Among the various designs of networking bots, the most common are chat bots, algorithms designed to converse with a human user, and social bots, algorithms designed to mimic human behaviors to converse with patterns similar to those of a human user. The history of social botting can be traced back to Alan Turing in the 1950s and his vision of designing sets of instructional code approved by the Turing test. In the 1960s Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a natural language processing computer program considered an early indicator of artificial intelligence algorithms. ELIZA inspired computer programmers to design tasked programs that can match behavior patterns to their sets of instruction. As a result, natural language processing has become an influencing factor to the development of artificial intelligence and social bots. And as information and thought see a progressive mass spreading on social media websites, innovative technological advancements are made following the same pattern.

Reports of political interferences in recent elections, including the 2016 US and 2017 UK general elections, have set the notion of bots being more prevalent because of the ethics that is challenged between the bot's design and the bot's designer. Emilio Ferrara, a computer scientist from the University of Southern California reporting on Communications of the ACM, said the lack of resources available to implement fact-checking and information verification results in the large volumes of false reports and claims made about these bots on social media platforms. In the case of Twitter, most of these bots are programmed with search filter capabilities that target keywords and phrases favoring political agendas and then retweet them. While the attention of bots is programmed to spread unverified information throughout the social media platforms, it is a challenge that programmers face in the wake of a hostile political climate. The Bot Effect is what Ferrera reported as the socialization of bots and human users creating a vulnerability to the leaking of personal information and polarizing influences outside the ethics of the bot's code, and was confirmed by Guillory Kramer in his study where he observed the behavior of emotionally volatile users and the impact the bots have on them, altering their perception of reality.


== Commercial bots ==

There has been a great deal of controversy about the use of bots in an automated trading function. Auction website eBay took legal action in an attempt to suppress a third-party company from using bots to look for bargains on its site; this approach backfired on eBay and attracted the attention of further bots. The United Kingdom-based bet exchange, Betfair, saw such a large amount of traffic coming from bots that it launched a WebService API aimed at bot programmers, through which it can actively manage bot interactions.
Bot farms are known to be used in online app stores, like the Apple App Store and Google Play, to manipulate positions or increase positive ratings/reviews.
A rapidly growing, benign form of internet bot is the chatbot. From 2016, when Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform, there has been an exponential growth of their use on that app alone. 30,000 bots were created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017. Avi Ben Ezra, CTO of SnatchBot, told Forbes that evidence from the use of their chatbot building platform pointed to a near future saving of millions of hours of human labor as 'live chat' on websites was replaced with bots.
Companies use internet bots to increase online engagement and streamline communication. Companies often use bots to cut down on cost; instead of employing people to communicate with consumers, companies have developed new ways to be efficient. These chatbots are used to answer customers' questions; for example, Domino's developed a chatbot that can take orders via Facebook Messenger. Chatbots allow companies to allocate their employees' time to other tasks.


== Malicious bots ==
One example of the malicious use of bots is the coordination and operation of an automated attack on networked computers, such as a denial-of-service attack by a botnet. Internet bots or web bots can also be used to commit click fraud and more recently have appeared around MMORPG games as computer game bots. Another category is represented by spambots, internet bots that attempt to spam large amounts of content on the Internet, usually adding advertising links. More than 94.2% of websites have experienced a bot attack.
There are malicious bots (and botnets) of the following types:

Spambots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages
Downloaded programs that suck bandwidth by downloading entire websites
Website scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages
Registration bots that sign up a specific email address to numerous services in order to have the confirmation messages flood the email inbox and distract from important messages indicating a security breach.
Viruses and worms
DDoS attacks
Botnets, zombie computers, etc.
Spambots that try to redirect people onto a malicious website, sometimes found in comment sections or forums of various websites
Viewbots create fake views
Bots that buy up higher-demand seats for concerts, particularly by ticket brokers who resell the tickets. These bots run through the purchase process of entertainment event-ticketing sites and obtain better seats by pulling as many seats back as it can.
Bots that are used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games to farm for resources that would otherwise take significant time or effort to obtain, which can be a concern for online in-game economies.
Bots that increase traffic counts on analytics reporting to extract money from advertisers. A study by Comscore found that over half of ads shown across thousands of campaigns between May 2012 and February 2013 were not served to human users.
Bots used on internet forums to automatically post inflammatory or nonsensical posts to disrupt the forum and anger users.
in 2012, journalist Percy von Lipinski reported that he discovered millions of bots or botted or pinged views at CNN iReport. CNN iReport quietly removed millions of views from the account of iReporter Chris Morrow. It is not known if the ad revenue received by CNN from the fake views was ever returned to the advertisers.
The most widely used anti-bot technique is CAPTCHA. Examples of providers include Recaptcha, Minteye, Solve Media and NuCaptcha. However, captchas are not foolproof in preventing bots, as they can often be circumvented by computer character recognition, security holes, and outsourcing captcha solving to cheap laborers.


== Protection against bots ==
In the case of academic surveys, protection against auto test taking bots is essential for maintaining accuracy and consistency in the results of the survey. Without proper precautions against these bots, the results of a survey can become skewed or inaccurate. Researchers indicate that the best way to keep bots out of surveys is to not allow them to enter to begin with. The survey should have participants from a reliable source, such as an existing department or group at work. This way, malicious bots don't have the opportunity to infiltrate the study.
Another form of protection against bots is a CAPTCHA test as mentioned in a previous section, which stands for ""Completely Automated Public Turing Test"".  This test is often used to quickly distinguish a real user from a bot by posing a challenge that a human could easily do but a bot would not.  This could be something like recognizing distorted letters or numbers, or picking out specific parts of an image, such as traffic lights on a busy street. CAPTCHAs are a great form of protection due to their ability to be completed quickly, low effort, and easy implementation.
There are also dedicated companies that specialize in protection against bots, including ones like DataDome, Akamai and Imperva.  These companies offer defense systems to their clients to protect them against DDoS attacks, infrastructure attacks, and overall cybersecurity.  While the pricing rates of these companies can often be expensive, the services offered can be crucial both for large corporations and small businesses.


== Human interaction with social bots ==

There are two main concerns with bots: clarity and face-to-face support. The cultural background of human beings affects the way they communicate with social bots. Others recognize that online bots have the ability to ""masquerade"" as humans online and have become highly aware of their presence. Due to this, some users are becoming unsure when interacting with a social bot.
Many people believe that bots are vastly less intelligent than humans, so they are not worthy of our respect.
Min-Sun Kim proposed five concerns or issues that may arise when communicating with a social robot, and they are avoiding the damage of peoples' feelings, minimizing impositions, disapproval from others, clarity issues, and how effective their messages may come across.
People who oppose social robots argue that they also take away from the genuine creations of human relationships. Opposition to social bots also note that the use of social bots add a new, unnecessary layer to privacy protection. Many users call for stricter legislation in relation to social bots to ensure private information remains preserved. The discussion of what to do with social bots and how far they should go remains ongoing.


== Social bots and political discussions ==
In recent years, political discussion platforms and politics on social media have become highly unstable and volatile. With the introduction of social bots on the political discussion scene, many users worry about their effect on the discussion and election outcomes. The biggest offender on the social media side is X (previously Twitter), where heated political discussions are raised both by bots and real users. The result is a misuse of political discussion on these platforms and a general mistrust among users for what they see.

"In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyberattack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. The range of attacks varies widely, spanning from inundating a server with millions of requests to slow its performance, overwhelming a server with a substantial amount of invalid data, to submitting requests with an illegitimate IP address.
In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. More sophisticated strategies are required to mitigate this type of attack; simply attempting to block a single source is insufficient as there are multiple sources.  A DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade and losing the business money. Criminal perpetrators of DDoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks or credit card payment gateways. Revenge and blackmail, as well as hacktivism, can motivate these attacks.


== History ==
Panix, the third-oldest ISP in the world, was the target of what is thought to be the first DoS attack. On September 6, 1996, Panix was subject to a SYN flood attack, which brought down its services for several days while hardware vendors, notably Cisco, figured out a proper defense. Another early demonstration of the DoS attack was made by Khan C. Smith in 1997 during a DEF CON event, disrupting Internet access to the Las Vegas Strip for over an hour. The release of sample code during the event led to the online attack of Sprint, EarthLink, E-Trade, and other major corporations in the year to follow. The largest DDoS attack to date happened in September 2017, when Google Cloud experienced an attack with a peak volume of 2.54 Tb/s, revealed by Google on October 17, 2020. The record holder was thought to be an attack executed by an unnamed customer of the US-based service provider Arbor Networks, reaching a peak of about 1.7 Tb/s.
In February 2020, Amazon Web Services experienced an attack with a peak volume of 2.3 Tb/s. In July 2021, CDN Provider Cloudflare boasted of protecting its client from a DDoS attack from a global Mirai botnet that was up to 17.2 million requests per second. Russian DDoS prevention provider Yandex said it blocked a HTTP pipelining DDoS attack on Sept. 5. 2021 that originated from unpatched Mikrotik networking gear. In the first half of 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine significantly shaped the cyberthreat landscape, with an increase in cyberattacks attributed to both state-sponsored actors and global hacktivist activities. The most notable event was a DDoS attack in February, the largest Ukraine has encountered, disrupting government and financial sector services. This wave of cyber aggression extended to Western allies like the UK, the US, and Germany. Particularly, the UK's financial sector saw an increase in DDoS attacks from nation-state actors and hacktivists, aimed at undermining Ukraine's allies.
In February 2023, Cloudflare faced a 71 million/requests per second attack which Cloudflare claims was the largest HTTP DDoS attack at the time. HTTP DDoS attacks are measured by HTTP requests per second instead of packets per second or bits per second. On July 10, 2023, the fanfiction platform Archive of Our Own (AO3) faced DDoS attacks, disrupting services. Anonymous Sudan, claiming the attack for religious and political reasons, was viewed skeptically by AO3 and experts. Flashpoint, a threat intelligence vendor, noted the group's past activities but doubted their stated motives. AO3, supported by the non-profit Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) and reliant on donations, is unlikely to meet the $30,000 Bitcoin ransom.
In August 2023, the group of hacktivists NoName057 targeted several Italian financial institutions, through the execution of slow DoS attacks. On 14 January 2024, they executed a DDoS attack on Swiss federal websites, prompted by President Zelensky's attendance at the Davos World Economic Forum. Switzerland's National Cyber Security Centre quickly mitigated the attack, ensuring core federal services remained secure, despite temporary accessibility issues on some websites. In October 2023, exploitation of a new vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol resulted in the record for largest HTTP DDoS attack being broken twice, once with a 201 million requests per second attack observed by Cloudflare, and again with a 398 million requests per second attack observed by Google. In August 2024, Global Secure Layer observed and reported on a record-breaking packet DDoS at 3.15 billion packets per second, which targeted an undisclosed number of unofficial Minecraft game servers.
In October 2024, the Internet Archive faced two severe DDoS attacks that brought the site completely offline, immediately following a previous attack that leaked records of over 31 million of the site's users. The hacktivist group SN_Blackmeta claimed the DDoS attack as retribution for American involvement in the Gaza war, despite the Internet Archive being unaffiliated with the United States government; however, their link with the preceding data leak remains unclear.


== Types ==
Denial-of-service attacks are characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate use of a service. There are two general forms of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services. The most serious attacks are distributed.


=== Distributed DoS ===
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware. A distributed denial of service attack typically involves more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks; fewer nodes may qualify as a DoS attack but is not a DDoS attack.
Most of the time, attackers operate from an endpoint that is not their intended target, for example using another user's machine to attack a server. By using another unsuspecting endpoint if it becomes compromised they can then move onto another workstation within the enterprise network. However, even faking lots of users and executing a DoS attack, a single attacker with few computers is still very limited in the amount of traffic they can generate. If the attacks are from multiple sources, it can be difficult for the host to identify and stop them.
The scale of DDoS attacks has continued to rise over recent years, by 2016 exceeding a terabit per second. Some common examples of DDoS attacks are UDP flooding, SYN flooding and DNS amplification.


==== Yo-yo attack ====
A yo-yo attack is a specific type of DoS/DDoS aimed at cloud-hosted applications which use autoscaling. During the attack, an attacker repeatedly changes between sending a lot of traffic (which causes a scale-up) and stopping the burst (causing a scale-down as a result).


=== Application layer attacks ===
An application layer DDoS attack (sometimes referred to as layer 7 DDoS attack) is a form of DDoS attack where attackers target application-layer processes. The attack over-exercises specific functions or features of a website with the intention to disable those functions or features. This application-layer attack is different from an entire network attack, and is often used against financial institutions to distract IT and security personnel from security breaches. In 2013, application-layer DDoS attacks represented 20% of all DDoS attacks. According to research by Akamai Technologies, there have been ""51 percent more application layer attacks"" from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014 and ""16 percent more"" from Q3 2014 to Q4 2014. In November 2017; Junade Ali, an engineer at Cloudflare noted that whilst network-level attacks continue to be of high capacity, they were occurring less frequently. Ali further noted that although network-level attacks were becoming less frequent, data from Cloudflare demonstrated that application-layer attacks were still showing no sign of slowing down.


==== Method of attack ====
The simplest DoS attack relies primarily on brute force, flooding the target with an overwhelming flux of packets, oversaturating its connection bandwidth or depleting the target's system resources. Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker's ability to generate the overwhelming flux of packets. A common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a botnet. An application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them. An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions. The attack on the application layer can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or search functions on a website.


=== Advanced persistent DoS ===
An advanced persistent DoS (APDoS) is associated with an advanced persistent threat and requires specialized DDoS mitigation. These attacks can persist for weeks; the longest continuous period noted so far lasted 38 days. This attack involved approximately 50+ petabits (50,000+ terabits) of malicious traffic. Attackers in this scenario may tactically switch between several targets to create a diversion to evade defensive DDoS countermeasures but all the while eventually concentrating the main thrust of the attack onto a single victim. In this scenario, attackers with continuous access to several very powerful network resources are capable of sustaining a prolonged campaign generating enormous levels of unamplified DDoS traffic. APDoS attacks are characterized by:

advanced reconnaissance (pre-attack OSINT and extensive decoyed scanning crafted to evade detection over long periods)
tactical execution (attack with both primary and secondary victims but the focus is on primary)
explicit motivation (a calculated end game/goal target)
large computing capacity (access to substantial computer power and network bandwidth)
simultaneous multi-threaded OSI layer attacks (sophisticated tools operating at layers 3 through 7)
persistence over extended periods (combining all the above into a concerted, well-managed attack across a range of targets).


=== Denial-of-service as a service ===

Some vendors provide so-called booter or stresser services, which have simple web-based front ends, and accept payment over the web. Marketed and promoted as stress-testing tools, they can be used to perform unauthorized denial-of-service attacks, and allow technically unsophisticated attackers access to sophisticated attack tools. Usually powered by a botnet, the traffic produced by a consumer stresser can range anywhere from 5-50 Gbit/s, which can, in most cases, deny the average home user internet access.


=== Markov-modulated denial-of-service attack ===
A Markov-modulated denial-of-service attack occurs when the attacker disrupts control packets using a hidden Markov model. A setting in which Markov-model based attacks are prevalent is online gaming as the disruption of the control packet undermines game play and system functionality.


== Symptoms ==
The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has identified symptoms of a denial-of-service attack to include:

unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing websites),
unavailability of a particular website, or
inability to access any website.


== Attack techniques ==


=== Attack tools ===
In cases such as MyDoom and Slowloris, the tools are embedded in malware and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. Stacheldraht is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.
In other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in Operation Payback organized by the group Anonymous. The Low Orbit Ion Cannon has typically been used in this way. Along with High Orbit Ion Cannon a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker-related forums and IRC channels.


=== Application-layer attacks ===
Application-layer attacks employ DoS-causing exploits and can cause server-running software to fill the disk space or consume all available memory or CPU time. Attacks may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim's disk space with logs. An attacker with shell-level access to a victim's computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a fork bomb. Another kind of application-level DoS attack is XDoS (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web application firewalls (WAFs). All attacks belonging to the category of timeout exploiting.
Slow DoS attacks implement an application-layer attack. Examples of threats are Slowloris, establishing pending connections with the victim, or SlowDroid, an attack running on mobile devices. Another target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on cloud computing. In this case, normally application-used resources are tied to a needed quality of service (QoS) level (e.g. responses should be less than 200 ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch) to raise more virtual resources from the provider to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests. The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels to handle the increased application traffic, to cause financial losses, or force them to become less competitive. A banana attack is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A LAND attack is of this type.


=== Degradation-of-service attacks ===
Pulsing zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as degradation-of-service, can be more difficult to detect and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more overall disruption than a denial-of-service attack. Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or is experiencing higher than normal legitimate traffic loads.


=== Distributed DoS attack ===
If an attacker mounts an attack from a single host, it would be classified as a DoS attack. Any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack. On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack. Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address before releasing the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack. A system may also be compromised with a trojan containing a zombie agent. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. Stacheldraht is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents, which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents. In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner's consent, for example, in Operation Payback, organized by the group Anonymous. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
These collections of compromised systems are known as botnets. DDoS tools like Stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered on IP spoofing and amplification like smurf attacks and fraggle attacks (types of bandwidth consumption attacks). SYN floods (a resource starvation attack) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users. More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of extortion – including against their business rivals. It has been reported that there are new attacks from internet of things (IoT) devices that have been involved in denial of service attacks. In one noted attack that was made peaked at around 20,000 requests per second which came from around 900 CCTV cameras. UK's GCHQ has tools built for DDoS, named PREDATORS FACE and ROLLING THUNDER.
Simple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses, giving the appearance of a distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP three-way handshake and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as SYN cookies may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding but do not address bandwidth exhaustion. In 2022, TCP attacks were the leading method in DDoS incidents, accounting for 63% of all DDoS activity. This includes tactics like TCP SYN, TCP ACK, and TCP floods. With TCP being the most widespread networking protocol, its attacks are expected to remain prevalent in the DDoS threat scene.


=== DDoS extortion ===
In 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, taking aim at financial institutions. Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack will be carried out if a ransom is not paid in bitcoin. Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom. The attackers tend to get into an extended extortion scheme once they recognize that the target is ready to pay.


=== HTTP slow POST DoS attack ===
First discovered in 2009, the HTTP slow POST attack sends a complete, legitimate HTTP POST header, which includes a Content-Length field to specify the size of the message body to follow. However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the Content-Length field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections until all resources for incoming connections on the victim server are exhausted, making any further connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other DDoS or DDoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, an HTTP slow POST attack targets the logical resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough network bandwidth and processing power to operate. Combined with the fact that the Apache HTTP Server will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful. HTTP slow POST attacks are difficult to differentiate from legitimate connections and are therefore able to bypass some protection systems. OWASP, an open source web application security project, released a tool to test the security of servers against this type of attack.


=== Challenge Collapsar (CC) attack ===
A Challenge Collapsar (CC) attack is an attack where standard HTTP requests are sent to a targeted web server frequently. The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the requests require complicated time-consuming algorithms or database operations which may exhaust the resources of the targeted web server. In 2004, a Chinese hacker nicknamed KiKi invented a hacking tool to send these kinds of requests to attack a NSFOCUS firewall named Collapsar, and thus the hacking tool was known as Challenge Collapsar, or CC for short. Consequently, this type of attack got the name CC attack.


=== Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood ===
A smurf attack relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets to be sent to all computer hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of IP packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim's computer will be flooded with traffic. This overloads the victim's computer and can even make it unusable during such an attack.
Ping flood is based on sending the victim an overwhelming number of ping packets, usually using the ping command from Unix-like hosts. It is very simple to launch, the primary requirement being access to greater bandwidth than the victim. Ping of death is based on sending the victim a malformed ping packet, which will lead to a system crash on a vulnerable system. The BlackNurse attack is an example of an attack taking advantage of the required Destination Port Unreachable ICMP packets.


=== Nuke ===
A nuke is an old-fashioned denial-of-service attack against computer networks consisting of fragmented or otherwise invalid ICMP packets sent to the target, achieved by using a modified ping utility to repeatedly send this corrupt data, thus slowing down the affected computer until it comes to a complete stop. A specific example of a nuke attack that gained some prominence is the WinNuke, which exploited the vulnerability in the NetBIOS handler in Windows 95. A string of out-of-band data was sent to TCP port 139 of the victim's machine, causing it to lock up and display a Blue Screen of Death.


=== Peer-to-peer attacks ===

Attackers have found a way to exploit a number of bugs in peer-to-peer servers to initiate DDoS attacks. The most aggressive of these peer-to-peer-DDoS attacks exploits DC++. With peer-to-peer there is no botnet and the attacker does not have to communicate with the clients it subverts. Instead, the attacker acts as a puppet master, instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim's website instead.


=== Permanent denial-of-service attacks ===
Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS), also known loosely as phlashing, is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike the distributed denial-of-service attack, a PDoS attack exploits security flaws which allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim's hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to replace a device's firmware with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware image—a process which when done legitimately is known as flashing. The intent is to brick the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced. The PDoS is a pure hardware-targeted attack that can be much faster and requires fewer resources than using a botnet in a DDoS attack. Because of these features, and the potential and high probability of security exploits on network-enabled embedded devices, this technique has come to the attention of numerous hacking communities. BrickerBot, a piece of malware that targeted IoT devices, used PDoS attacks to disable its targets. PhlashDance is a tool created by Rich Smith (an employee of Hewlett-Packard's Systems Security Lab) used to detect and demonstrate PDoS vulnerabilities at the 2008 EUSecWest Applied Security Conference in London, UK.


=== Reflected attack ===
A distributed denial-of-service attack may involve sending forged requests of some type to a very large number of computers that will reply to the requests. Using Internet Protocol address spoofing, the source address is set to that of the targeted victim, which means all the replies will go to (and flood) the target. This reflected attack form is sometimes called a distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack. ICMP echo request attacks (Smurf attacks) can be considered one form of reflected attack, as the flooding hosts send Echo Requests to the broadcast addresses of mis-configured networks, thereby enticing hosts to send Echo Reply packets to the victim. Some early DDoS programs implemented a distributed form of this attack.


=== Amplification ===
Amplification attacks are used to magnify the bandwidth that is sent to a victim. Many services can be exploited to act as reflectors, some harder to block than others. US-CERT have observed that different services may result in different amplification factors, as tabulated below:

DNS amplification attacks involves an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request to one or more public DNS servers, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Network Time Protocol (NTP) can also be exploited as reflectors in an amplification attack. An example of an amplified DDoS attack through the NTP is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result in a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim. It is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. To bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which have led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.


=== Mirai botnet ===
The Mirai botnet works by using a computer worm to infect hundreds of thousands of IoT devices across the internet. The worm propagates through networks and systems taking control of poorly protected IoT devices such as thermostats, Wi-Fi-enabled clocks, and washing machines. The owner or user will usually have no immediate indication of when the device becomes infected. The IoT device itself is not the direct target of the attack, it is used as a part of a larger attack. Once the hacker has enslaved the desired number of devices, they instruct the devices to try to contact an ISP. In October 2016, a Mirai botnet attacked Dyn which is the ISP for sites such as Twitter, Netflix, etc. As soon as this occurred, these websites were all unreachable for several hours.


=== R-U-Dead-Yet? (RUDY) ===
RUDY attack targets web applications by starvation of available sessions on the web server. Much like Slowloris, RUDY keeps sessions at halt using never-ending POST transmissions and sending an arbitrarily large content-length header value.


=== SACK Panic ===
Manipulating maximum segment size and selective acknowledgement (SACK) may be used by a remote peer to cause a denial of service by an integer overflow in the Linux kernel, potentially causing a kernel panic. Jonathan Looney discovered CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478, CVE-2019-11479 on June 17, 2019.


=== Shrew attack ===
The shrew attack is a denial-of-service attack on the Transmission Control Protocol where the attacker employs man-in-the-middle techniques. It exploits a weakness in TCP's re-transmission timeout mechanism, using short synchronized bursts of traffic to disrupt TCP connections on the same link.


=== Slow read attack ===
A slow read attack sends legitimate application layer requests, but reads responses very slowly, keeping connections open longer hoping to exhaust the server's connection pool. The slow read is achieved by advertising a very small number for the TCP Receive Window size, and at the same time emptying clients' TCP receive buffer slowly, which causes a very low data flow rate.


=== Sophisticated low-bandwidth Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack ===
A sophisticated low-bandwidth DDoS attack is a form of DoS that uses less traffic and increases its effectiveness by aiming at a weak point in the victim's system design, i.e., the attacker sends traffic consisting of complicated requests to the system. Essentially, a sophisticated DDoS attack is lower in cost due to its use of less traffic, is smaller in size making it more difficult to identify, and it has the ability to hurt systems which are protected by flow control mechanisms.


=== SYN flood ===
A SYN flood occurs when a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged sender address. Each of these packets is handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn a half-open connection, send back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet, and wait for a packet in response from the sender address. However, because the sender's address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections exhaust the available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.


=== Teardrop attacks ===

A teardrop attack involves sending mangled IP fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to the target machine. This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their TCP/IP fragmentation re-assembly code. Windows 3.1x, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, as well as versions of Linux prior to versions 2.0.32 and 2.1.63 are vulnerable to this attack. One of the fields in an IP header is the fragment offset field, indicating the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets resulting in a denial-of-service condition.


=== Telephony denial-of-service ===
Voice over IP has made abusive origination of large numbers of telephone voice calls inexpensive and easily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through caller ID spoofing. According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes:

A scammer contacts the victim's banker or broker, impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer. The banker's attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim's telephone lines are being flooded with bogus calls, rendering the victim unreachable.
A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding payday loan for thousands of dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim's employer with automated calls. In some cases, the displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.
Swatting: A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police; when the victim balks, the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victim's number. Police soon arrive at the victim's residence attempting to find the origin of the calls.
TDoS can exist even without Internet telephony. In the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal, telemarketers were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-area code-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of calls daily in response to the song ""867-5309/Jenny"". TDoS differs from other telephone harassment (such as prank calls and obscene phone calls) by the number of calls originated. By occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls. Related exploits include SMS flooding attacks and black fax or continuous fax transmission by using a loop of paper at the sender.


=== TTL expiry attack ===
It takes more router resources to drop a packet with a TTL value of 1 or less than it does to forward a packet with a higher TTL value. When a packet is dropped due to TTL expiry, the router CPU must generate and send an ICMP time exceeded response. Generating many of these responses can overload the router's CPU.


=== UPnP attack ===
A UPnP attack uses an existing vulnerability in Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol to get past network security and flood a target's network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router that forwards requests from one outer source to another. The UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it harder to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the Imperva researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.


=== SSDP reflection attack ===
In 2014, it was discovered that Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) was being used in DDoS attacks known as an SSDP reflection attack with amplification. Many devices, including some residential routers, have a vulnerability in the UPnP software that allows an attacker to get replies from UDP port 1900 to a destination address of their choice. With a botnet of thousands of devices, the attackers can generate sufficient packet rates and occupy bandwidth to saturate links, causing the denial of services. Because of this weakness, the network company Cloudflare has described SSDP as the ""Stupidly Simple DDoS Protocol"".


=== ARP spoofing ===
ARP spoofing is a common DoS attack that involves a vulnerability in the ARP protocol that allows an attacker to associate their MAC address to the IP address of another computer or gateway, causing traffic intended for the original authentic IP to be re-routed to that of the attacker, causing a denial of service.


== Defense techniques ==

Defensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic the tools identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate. A list of response tools include the following.


=== Upstream filtering ===
All traffic destined to the victim is diverted to pass through a cleaning center or a scrubbing center via various methods such as: changing the victim IP address in the DNS system, tunneling methods (GRE/VRF, MPLS, SDN), proxies, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits. The cleaning center separates bad traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only passes good legitimate traffic to the victim server. The victim needs central connectivity to the Internet to use this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the cleaning center. DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.


=== Application front end hardware ===
Application front-end hardware is intelligent hardware placed on the network before traffic reaches the servers. It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches and as part of bandwidth management. Application front-end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the network, and identifies and drops dangerous or suspicious flows.


=== Application level key completion indicators ===
Approaches to detection of DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate. These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called key completion indicators. In essence, these techniques are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. An analogy is to a brick-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. If a mob of customers arrived in the store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.


=== Blackholing and sinkholing ===
With blackhole routing, all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a black hole (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP. A DNS sinkhole routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing may not be efficient for severe attacks.


=== IPS based prevention ===
Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems that work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks. An ASIC based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the processing power and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a circuit breaker in an automated way.


=== DDS based defense ===
More focused on the problem than IPS, a DoS defense system (DDS) can block connection-based DoS attacks and those with legitimate content but bad intent. A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods). DDS has a purpose-built system that can easily identify and obstruct denial of service attacks at a greater speed than a software-based system.


=== Firewalls ===
In the case of a simple attack, a firewall can be adjusted to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports, or the originating IP addresses. More complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from receiving and serving legitimate traffic. Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls may be bypassed during the attacks.


=== Routers ===
Similar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and ACL capabilities. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. Nokia SR-OS using FP4 or FP5 processors offers DDoS protection. Nokia SR-OS also uses big data analytics-based Nokia Deepfield Defender for DDoS protection. Cisco IOS has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.


=== Switches ===
Most switches have some rate-limiting and ACL capability. Some switches provide automatic or system-wide rate limiting, traffic shaping, delayed binding (TCP splicing), deep packet inspection and bogon filtering (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing. These schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly, content-based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks using Martian packets can be prevented using bogon filtering. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate thresholds have been set correctly. WAN-link failover will work as long as both links have a DoS prevention mechanism.


== Blocking vulnerable ports ==
Threats may be associated with specific TCP or UDP port numbers. Blocking these ports at the firewall can mitigate an attack. For example, in an SSDP reflection attack, the key mitigation is to block incoming UDP traffic on port 1900.


== Blocking based on TTL ==
Blocking specific Time to live (TTL) values based on the network path length can be a viable option for blocking spoofed attacks. 


== Unintentional denial-of-service ==
An unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular users – potentially hundreds of thousands of people – click that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity. When Michael Jackson died in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed. Many sites' servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like ""automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application"".
News sites and link sites – sites whose primary function is to provide links to interesting content elsewhere on the Internet – are most likely to cause this phenomenon. The canonical example is the Slashdot effect when receiving traffic from Slashdot. It is also known as ""the Reddit hug of death"" and ""the Digg effect"".
Similar unintentional denial-of-service can also occur via other media, e.g. when a URL is mentioned on television. In March 2014, after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, DigitalGlobe launched a crowdsourcing service on which users could help search for the missing jet in satellite images. The response overwhelmed the company's servers. An unintentional denial-of-service may also result from a prescheduled event created by the website itself, as was the case of the Census in Australia in 2016.
Legal action has been taken in at least one such case. In 2006, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment Corporation sued YouTube: massive numbers of would-be YouTube.com users accidentally typed the tube company's URL, utube.com. As a result, the tube company ended up having to spend large amounts of money on upgrading its bandwidth. The company appears to have taken advantage of the situation, with utube.com now containing ads and receiving advertisement revenue.
Routers have also been known to create unintentional DoS attacks, as both D-Link and Netgear routers have overloaded NTP servers by flooding them without respecting the restrictions of client types or geographical limitations.


== Side effects of attacks ==


=== Backscatter ===

In computer network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs the source address in IP packets sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.
If the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly, the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations. This effect can be used by network telescopes as indirect evidence of such attacks. The term backscatter analysis refers to observing backscatter packets arriving at a statistically significant portion of the IP address space to determine the characteristics of DoS attacks and victims.


== Legality ==

Many jurisdictions have laws under which denial-of-service attacks are illegal. UNCTAD highlights that 156 countries, or 80% globally, have enacted cybercrime laws to combat its widespread impact. Adoption rates vary by region, with Europe at a 91% rate, and Africa at 72%.
In the US, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with penalties that include years of imprisonment. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the US Department of Justice handles cases of DoS and DDoS. In one example, in July 2019, Austin Thompson, aka DerpTrolling, was sentenced to 27 months in prison and $95,000 restitution by a federal court for conducting multiple DDoS attacks on major video gaming companies, disrupting their systems from hours to days.
In European countries, committing criminal denial-of-service attacks may, as a minimum, lead to arrest. The United Kingdom is unusual in that it specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison with the Police and Justice Act 2006, which amended Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.
In January 2019, Europol announced that ""actions are currently underway worldwide to track down the users"" of Webstresser.org, a former DDoS marketplace that was shut down in April 2018 as part of Operation PowerOFF. Europol said UK police were conducting a number of ""live operations"" targeting over 250 users of Webstresser and other DDoS services.
On January 7, 2013, Anonymous posted a petition on the whitehouse.gov site asking that DDoS be recognized as a legal form of protest similar to the Occupy movement, the claim being that the similarity in the purpose of both is same.

"Bridging Finance Inc. was a Canadian private lender based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that was placed in receivership by the Ontario Court of Justice following an investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). Investors in the firm's funds are expected to lose approximately 58-66% of their capital. That is one of the ""largest collapses of an investment fund in Canadian history."" In 2023, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) alleged that former CEO David Sharpe, former Chief Investment Officer Natasha Sharpe and former Chief Compliance Officer, Andrew Mushore ""committed fraud, misappropriated funds, made misleading and untrue statements and misled investigators."" On October 29th 2024, the Ontario Securities Commission Tribunal ruled that Bridging Finance executives David and Natasha Sharpe committed fraud, and that Andrew Mushore ""indirectly participated"" in the fraudulent activities.


== History and ownership ==
Bridging was owned by Natasha Sharpe, Jenny Coco and Rocky Coco (the Cocos are brother and sister owners of Coco Paving Inc.)  Sharpe worked with the Cocos in a previous role at the Bank of Montreal where she provided commercial banking services to Coco Paving.  Sharpe joined the board of directors of the Coco Group in 2011.  Subsequently, the Cocos provided capital to launch Bridging in 2012.  
In 2019, Natasha Sharpe and other shareholders agreed to sell 50% of Bridging's equity to Gary Ng for $50 million.  It was later revealed that Ng paid for the investment with the proceeds of a $32 million loan that he received from one of Bridging's credit funds.  This use of client money to fund a capital transaction that benefited Bridging's owners is one of the transactions listed by the OSC as being under investigation


== Conflicts of interest and misuse of client funds ==
The principal conflicts of interest being investigated by the OSC:

Payments from Sean McCoshen related to loans made to McCoshen's company Alaska-Alberta Railway Development Corporation.  The OSC alleges that following the funding of loans to various McCoshen companies, McCoshen funnelled a total of $19.5 million to David Sharpe, largely through his personal chequing account. The OSC discovered that Natasha Sharpe received $250,000 from one of McCoshen's companies.
Use of Bridging client funds to pay for purchase of Ninepoint Partners LP's management interest in Sprott Bridging Income Fund LP.  With the cooperation of Rishi Gautam, who was a Bridging borrower at the time, the OSC discovered that the Sharpes and Mushore misappropriated $40 million to pay for the purchase, which ultimately benefited Bridging's shareholders Natasha Sharpe and the Cocos..
The OSC has discovered that Mr. Sharpe was able to facilitate their misappropriation by a false loan invoice by using the signature of one of their borrowers from a completely different loan document. This made it appear as though the money came from elsewhere. This action by Mr. Sharpe wrongfully implicated Mr. Gautam who was the CEO of MJardin Group Inc. at the time.
The use of Bridging client funds to enable Gary Ng to purchase 50% of Bridging's shares from Natasha Sharpe and the Cocos.  After Ng was the majority shareholder of Bridging, Bridging provided additional loans to various Ng-controlled  companies.  The OSC also states that Ng paid $500,000 to each of David and Natasha Sharpe in November 2019.  According to the OSC, ""neither payment served a legitimate commercial purpose"".


== Receivership and financial recovery for investors ==
Bridging was placed into receivership by the Ontario Court of Justice on 30 April 2021.  PwC terminated David Sharpe and Natasha Sharpe within days of taking over as receiver.
In its role as receiver, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) launched a process to sell Bridging's debt portfolio. The proceeds of the sale would be used to partially repay investors in Bridging's private credit funds.  In April 2022, PwC stated that the bids that it received for the portfolio were below the likely value of an orderly liquidation.  PwC then recommended to the court that the portfolio be allowed run-off over a five-year period. PwC's estimates of likely recoveries were between 34% and 42%, that would lead to total losses of approximately $1.3 billion out of the peak assets of $2.09 billion.
In April 2023 PwC launched a series of lawsuits against Bridging's former auditor, KMPG, Bridging insiders and external borrowers implicated in the fraud cases outlined by the OSC:

PWC filed suit against KPMG on 12 April 2023 for CAD$1.4 billion. PwC alleges that ""throughout KPMG’s tenure, the Bridging funds materially misrepresented the value of their assets and financial performance. KPMG negligently failed to detect and report on these misstatements.”
As the investigations have continued, it has become clear that Rishi Gautam was a victim of the principal of Bridging Finance and their fraudulent activities who was wrongly accused and is no longer being investigated by the OSC. As a result, most of the lawsuits in which he was included as one of the defendants have discontinued and withdrawn the claims against him.
PWC has also disclosed that they, as the receiver,  are actively trying to track down ""funds transferred by certain former principals of Bridging Finance to, among other jurisdictions, Liechtenstein and the Cayman Islands.”


== OSC Tribunal finds bridging finance executives guilty of fraud ==
On October 29, 2024, Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) Tribunal ruled that Bridging Finance Inc. (BFI) founders David and Natasha Sharpe engaged in fraud, leading to over $1 billion in investor losses.
The tribunal found that the Sharpes conflicted transactions and securities violations, including channeling millions in loans to companies tied to businessman Sean McCoshen, who paid kickbacks to the Sharpes. The tribunal also found that $40 million was used to benefit BFI and the Sharpes in a deal with Ninepoint Partners LP, and loans were also transferred to Gary Ng, who used fake collateral to buy a stake in BFI.
Natasha Sharpe was also implicated in approving $32 million in loans to Gary Ng's companies, with Mr. Ng paying the Sharpes $1 million. David Sharpe received $19.5 million in kickbacks from Sean McCoshen, with $18.2 million traced to investor funds.
The tribunal found the Sharpes guilty of fraud, document forgery, and misleading investigators. It further noted that David Sharpe attempted to intimidate former employees, business associates, and borrowers, while wrongfully implicating others in their fraudulent schemes. BFI’s former compliance officer Andrew Mushore was also found to have indirectly participated in the misconduct.


== Legal Proceedings ==
In April 2023 PwC launched a series of lawsuits against Bridging's former auditor, KMPG, Bridging insiders and external borrowers implicated in the fraud cases outlined by the OSC: PWC filed suit against KPMG on 12 April 2023 for CAD$1.4 billion. PwC alleges that ""throughout KPMG’s tenure, the Bridging funds materially misrepresented the value of their assets and financial performance. KPMG negligently failed to detect and report on these misstatements.” 
In June 2025, PWC filed suit against Ernst & Young for $1.4 billion alleging that EY failed to detect fraud when it audited several Bridging funds.

"The United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), or the Postal Inspectors, is the federal law enforcement arm of the United States Postal Service. It supports and protects the U.S. Postal Service, its employees, infrastructure, and customers by enforcing the laws that defend the United States' mail system from illegal or dangerous use. Its jurisdiction covers any crimes that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U.S. Mail, the postal system, or postal employees. With roots going back to the late 18th century, the USPIS is the country's oldest continuously operating federal law enforcement agency.
There are approximately 200 federal crimes that can be committed which involve the mail. Therefore, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service's activities are broad and ever-changing. In 2021, postal inspectors made 5,141 arrests leading to more than 3,700 convictions, mostly involving mail theft, mail fraud, and prohibited mailings. The growth in illegal narcotics has resulted in over 19,000 arrests and the seizure of $18 million in drug proceeds since 2010. In 2022, Postal inspectors performed over 5,300 seizures that resulted in almost 17,000 pounds of illicit drugs being taken off the streets. In some cases, these seizures were performed with the assistance of a detection dog.
As of 2022, there were about 1,250 postal inspectors, who are authorized to carry weapons, make arrests, execute federal search warrants, and serve subpoenas.


== History ==
The Postal Inspection Service has the oldest origins of any federal law enforcement agency in the United States pre-dating the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Its roots can be traced back to 1775 when colonial postmaster general Benjamin Franklin first appointed a ""surveyor"" to regulate and audit the mail.
When Franklin was appointed Postmaster General under the Second Continental Congress, the audit system he created continued. One of Franklin's first acts as Postmaster General was to appoint William Goddard as the first postal surveyor of the newly founded American postal system, in charge of inspecting the integrity and security of postal routes, regulating post offices, and auditing their accounts. A letter from Franklin to Goddard, dated August 7, 1775,  asked Goddard to carry out these duties.
In 1801, the title of ""Surveyor"" was changed to ""Special Agent"", and the Postal Inspection Service was the first federal law enforcement agency to use the title Special Agent for its officers. In 1830, the special agents were organized into the Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations. In 1873, one of their primary duties was the enforcement of obscenity prohibitions under the Comstock Act, named after Postal Inspector Anthony Comstock. Congress changed this title to ""Post Office Inspector"" in 1880 to differentiate the federal postal agents from the multitude of other ""special agents"" employed by railway and stagecoach companies.
Finally, in 1954, the title changed again to ""Postal Inspector"" to reflect their relationship to all aspects of the postal system and the U.S. mail, instead of only post offices.


== Jurisdiction and activities ==
As fact-finding and investigative agents, postal inspectors are sworn federal law enforcement officers who carry firearms, make arrests, and serve federal search warrants and subpoenas. Inspectors work closely with U.S. attorneys, other law enforcement agencies, and local prosecutors to investigate postal cases and prepare them for court. For example, on cases involving international mail, postal inspectors work closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); while on domestic mail cases, Inspectors work closely with state and local law enforcement agencies.
The USPIS has responsibility to safeguard over 600,000 Postal Service employees and billions of pieces of mail transported globally each year by air, land, rail, and sea.
Prior to 1996, USPIS was the only investigative agency of the Postal Service, but that changed with the creation of the USPS Office of Inspector General in 1996. The USPS OIG conducts independent audits and investigations of USPS programs and operations to determine whether they are efficient and cost-effective. Before 1996, this auditing function was carried out by Postal Inspectors. These investigations help detect fraud, waste, and misconduct within USPS, and they have a deterrent effect on postal crimes.

Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, the USPIS has also investigated several cases where ricin, anthrax, and other toxic substances were sent through the mail. Although the USPIS has a wide jurisdiction, USPIS investigations can be categorized into  seven types of investigative teams and functions:

Fraud: These types of investigation involve crimes that use the mails to facilitate fraud against consumers, business, and government. Federal statutes that surround these types of investigations include mail fraud and other criminal statutes when they are tied to the mails, such as bank fraud, identity theft, credit card fraud, wire fraud, and Internet/computer fraud. Mail fraud is a statute that is used in prosecuting many white collar crimes, including Ponzi schemes, 419 frauds, and other white collar crimes where the mail was used to facilitate the fraud. This extends to public corruption (under the ""Honest Services"" provision of the federal fraud statutes). In the 1960s and 70s, inspectors under regional chief postal inspectors, such as Martin McGee, known as ""Mr. Mail Fraud,"" exposed and prosecuted numerous swindles involving land sales, phony advertising practices, insurance ripoffs, and fraudulent charitable organizations using mail fraud charges. McGee is credited with assisting in the conviction of former Illinois governor Otto Kerner on mail fraud charges.
External Crime and Crime Teams: The External Crimes Function of USPIS is a function that investigates any theft of US mail by non employees, assaults of postal employees, and theft and robberies of postal property. This function also investigates robberies of postal employees and postal facilities, burglaries of postal facilities, and assaults and murders of postal employees. This investigative function ensures that trust in the U.S. mail system is maintained.
Prohibited Mailing Investigations: Prohibited mailing investigations focus on the prohibited mailing of contraband including: narcotics, precursors, and proceeds; child pornography and other sexually prohibited materials; and hazardous materials to include: mail bombs; and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The laundering of narcotics and other criminal proceeds through the use of postal money orders is sometimes categorized under this investigative function.
Aviation and Homeland Security: These investigations include the securing and protecting of transportation of U.S. mail and any risk that might compromise the security of the homeland because of these mails. Security audits are conducted by these teams to ensure that postal service facilities are secure from not only theft and robberies but also manmade and natural disasters.
Revenue Investigations: These investigations identify fraudulent practices conducted by business and consumers that mail items without proper postage or with counterfeit postage and indicia. Also included are any other crimes that defraud the USPS of revenue.
International Investigations and Global Security: This investigative function ensures that international mail is secured and that international business decisions and campaigns remain safe and secure. USPIS maintains investigators in the U.S. and in posts around the world for protection, liaison, and intelligence.
Joint Task Force Investigations: USPIS participates in joint task force investigations where laws applicable to the mail service are involved. These cases are often wide-ranging and involve every law enforcement agency of the federal government. For example, USPIS participated in the largest count indictment and conviction in NASA history, the Omniplan case, that put seven companies out of business and ended with the conviction of Omniplan owner, Ralph Montijo, on 179 federal crimes.
The Postal Inspection Service's Technical Services Unit (TSU) provides investigative support through the use of new technology and the operations of two national communication centers known as the National Law Enforcement Control Centers (NLECC). In 2003, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement renamed their national communication center, previously known as ""Sector"" to the ""National Law Enforcement Communications Center"" (also known as NLECC). USPIS NLECC and ICE NLECC are two independent federal law enforcement radio communications centers that coincidentally share the same acronym and an almost identical name.


=== Ted Kaczynski, 1978-1986 ===

From 1978 to 1996, Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, mailed or placed 16 explosive devices, killing three and injuring 26 others. The nine mailed bombs were sent to university professors and airline and advertising executives. Kaczynski's first two bombs were investigated by Postal Inspectors, with the FBI getting involved after he targeted an American Airlines flight in 1979. Chemist Jim Upton from the Inspection Service Crime Lab was the first person to tie the devices to a single bomb maker. Postal Inspectors, FBI and ATF agents created the UNABOM Task Force, a combination of the words ""university"" and ""airline bomber"". The first federal agent to interview Kaczynski was Postal Inspector Paul Wilhelmus.


=== National Forensic Laboratory, 1940-present ===
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service first established a crime lab in 1940. Today, the National Forensic Laboratory is located in Dulles, Virginia in a two-story, 44,000-square-foot facility. The lab is staffed by forensic scientists and technical experts and consists of four units: the Questioned Documents Unit, the Fingerprint Unit, the Physical Sciences Unit, and the Digital Evidence Unit. The laboratory is overseen by a laboratory director, and each of the four units is overseen by an assistant laboratory director. There are also four satellite offices, located in New York, Chicago, Memphis, and San Francisco.


== Police force ==
Postal police officers are the uniformed division of the Postal Inspection Service. They are stationed at major postal facilities throughout the United States. In connection with property owned, occupied, or controlled by the Postal Service, postal police officers enforce Postal Service regulations and applicable federal laws for the protection of persons and property, consistent with statutory and regulatory authority, and ensures safety and security of personnel, customers, property, mail, and mail-in-transit.


== USPIS Academy ==
The Postal Inspection Service maintains an in-residence law enforcement academy located at the W.F. Bolger Center for Leadership Development based in Potomac, Maryland. It is a federally accredited law enforcement academy by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA), and is administered by the Career Development Unit (CDU) of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.


== Fallen officers ==
Fifteen U.S. postal inspectors and postal police officers have died in the line of duty.
Their names have been etched on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial wall and to a Postal Inspection Service plaque at the agency's national headquarters, both located in Washington, D.C.

== Campaigns and programs ==
For more than 150 years, postal inspectors have pursued criminals who use the mail to defraud victims. Their experience with fraud investigations has encompassed many types of schemes from the most simple to highly complex, international frauds. Fraud is a crime that can be reduced or prevented by educating the general public and specific groups, such as the elderly and military veterans. Accordingly, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service has conducted numerous crime prevention campaigns over the years. The following list has been compiled for historical reference.Active Crime Prevention Campaigns:


=== Collaboration with Department of Homeland Security ===
In April 2025, it became known that USPIS was collaborating with the Department of Homeland Security in a task force, detain and deport undocumented immigrants under the second Trump administration.


=== International Association of Financial Crimes Investigators (IAFCI) ===
IAFCI is a non-profit international organization, which provides services and shares information about financial fraud, fraud investigation, and fraud prevention methods. IAFCI members consist of law enforcement, banking, and retail/service members that are in the industry. The Postal Inspection Service plays a significant role coordinating and sponsoring training conferences, which are typically attended by several hundred members, drawn from the various sectors mentioned. Training conferences include sessions related to consumer fraud, identity theft, and credit card fraud, as well as banking and credit card industry best practices.


=== Internet Covert Operations Program ===
The Postal Inspection Service's Internet Covert Operations Program (iCOP) is a surveillance program that monitors social media, cryptocurrency transactions, and USPS internal systems to facilitate ""the identification, disruption, and dismantling of individuals and organizations that use the mail or USPS online tools to facilitate black market Internet trade or other illegal activities"". The initiative also claims to assess ""threats to Postal Service employees and its infrastructure by monitoring publicly available open source information"". It is one of seven functional groups falling under the Postal Inspection Service's wider cybercrime program.
In 2019, iCOP produced over 200 intelligence reports for dissemination among USPIS officers.
iCOP intelligence products have led to the seizure of at least $300,000 in cryptocurrency assets.
In April 2021, a leaked bulletin labeled ""law enforcement sensitive"" was distributed through DHS fusion centers and detailed planned protests on March 20 for the World Wide Rally for Freedom and Democracy. Public exposure of this bulletin raised questions about whether the monitoring of protests and protestors fell under USPIS's area of law enforcement jurisdiction.
According to a 2021 USPIS presentation, obtained by Vice Media Motherboard the iCOP Analytics Team's mission is to, ""identify and develop intelligence on targets operating on the clear and dark webs for all Inspection Service investigations. Analytics Team specializes in providing actionable intelligence through cryptocurrency tracking, open source intelligence and social media analysis, geospatial mapping and data visualization, and USPS backend and network data exploitation.""


=== National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW) ===
Established in 1998, National Consumer Protection Week is a federal program led by the Federal Trade Commission to educate consumers about various types of fraud, including sweepstakes/prize scams, foreign lottery fraud, mail and Internet fraud, identity theft, and work-at-home scams. Since the program's inception, the Postal Inspection Service has supported NCPW through partnerships with public and private organizations, including the Postal Service Consumer Advocate's Office, AARP, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Federation of America, Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, National Association of Attorneys General, and others.


=== National Crime Victims’ Rights Week ===
Established in 1981 under the Reagan administration, National Crime Victims’ Rights Week is a federal program led by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Postal Inspection Service has partnered with the DOJ since the program's founding, helping to communicate the importance of early intervention and victim services in establishing trust with victims, which begins to restore their hope for healing and recovery.


=== Operation Protect Veterans (OPV) ===
In November 2017, AARP Fraud Watch Network and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service jointly announced the launch of Operation Protect Veterans — a national campaign to warn those who have served in the military about scams and fraud schemes that target veterans. AARP and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service warned veterans and their families to be on the lookout for some of the most common schemes and scams directed at veterans. To raise scam awareness among veterans and their families, Operation Protect Veterans utilizes advertising, social media, email messages, brochures, mass mailings, and a website. In a major component of the outreach campaign, printed materials were distributed to over 30,000 Post Offices, AARP's state offices, senior centers, and public libraries.


=== Project Safe Delivery ===
Project Safe Delivery is a crime prevention and law enforcement campaign launched by the United States Postal Service and the Postal Inspection Service in May 2023 that seeks to reduce mail theft and robberies through multiple efforts, including the deployment of high-security blue collection boxes, the installation of electronic locks to replace older locks, law enforcement surges in locations of heightened criminal activity, and other preventive and protective efforts in coordination with federal, state, and local law enforcement. To strengthen this effort, the Inspection Service also increased monetary rewards for information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators of postal crimes.


=== Video PSAs ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service created a video public service announcement (PSA) that provided the public important information about COVID scams. Due to the success of this PSA, the concept was expanded and more PSAs were created to cover a wide range of topics from romance scams to smishing scams. These PSAs are available on the Inspection Service's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube channels, as well as on the USPIS website.
Previous Crime Prevention Campaigns:


=== 2 SMRT 4U ===
In 2006 the Postal Inspection Service created the ""2 SMRT 4U"" campaign aimed at teenage girls, the group most targeted by online sexual predators. It established the website to educate teens about how to chat and post wisely online. The website has been rebranded NSTeens.org (NetSmartz), but still provides educational information for teens. For its dedication to protecting children and fighting child exploitation, the United States Department of Justice honored the Postal Inspection Service with its Internet Safety Award.


=== Alliance for Consumer Fraud Awareness (ACFA) ===
The ACFA focused on scams that targeted consumers via the U.S. Mail or Internet, involving counterfeit checks, gift checks, traveler's checks, or money orders. Launched in 2007, the campaign sought to increase awareness about the schemes, to give consumers valuable information about protecting their assets, and to provide steps they can take to report solicitations. ACFA was a private-public initiative organized by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service with members representing financial institutions, associations, consumer advocacy groups, and businesses. The Inspection Service provided support to the initiative and the National Consumer Fraud Awareness Campaign it sponsored via the CFF. Other campaign members contributed financially and through in-kind services to the National Consumers League to finance the building and maintenance of the campaign Web site Fakechecks.org and to help distribute information to customers and employees. The website is no longer active.


=== The Consumer Alert News Network (CANN) ===
The Consumer Alert News network was launched in September 2012 as an innovative consumer outreach/fraud prevention campaign. Through CANN, the Postal Inspection Service developed, produced, and distributed a series of 90-second consumer news alerts to local television stations nationwide, which were embedded in the local newscasts. These segments featured consumer alerts and crime prevention tips covering a wide range of subject matter, including identity theft, mail fraud scams, Internet phishing, and international cross-border schemes. They featured Postal Inspectors and actual case victims discussing the nuances of the case and how to avoid falling prey to similar schemes. The series also highlighted the Postal Service's commitment to protecting American consumers. More than 500 news reports were produced and distributed, airing in the news hour on 124 TV stations and reaching over 77 percent of the nation's viewing audience. As CANN culminated in 2017, the Inspection Service created a 30-minute CANN special segment hosted by Terry Serpico of The Inspectors TV show highlighting Inspectors talking about various crimes and scams.


=== Consumer Fraud Forums ===
In 2005, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service sponsored Consumer Fraud Forums in Milwaukee, St. Louis, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Cincinnati. The purpose of the forums was to create an awareness of the consumer fraud program, facilitate discussion on current crime prevention initiatives and strategies, and foster working relationships among various local law enforcement and consumer protection agencies.


=== Crime Watch ===
From 2000 to 2004, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service implemented a program with the North American Precis Syndicate (NAPS) to produce one- and two-column newspaper articles on fraud prevention. The program, called “Crime Watch,” featured articles which were made available to 10,000 daily and non-daily newspapers at the time. The USPIS articles were rated as the most published NAPS articles for four years in a row. The program was later expanded to 30-second radio spots that were aired on more than 700 radio stations nationwide.


=== Deliver Me Home ===
The joint program sponsored by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Postal Service assists Postal Inspectors and other law enforcement officers in their investigation of cases involving abducted or missing children. Combining agency resources increased the chances that an abducted, lost, or missing child would be found and safely delivered home. During 2006, Deliver Me Home was successful in locating 20 missing children, which brought the total to 49 children located since the program's inception in September 2004. Integral to Deliver Me Home were the missing children flyers, which Postal Inspectors dispatched to targeted ZIP Codes to alert communities and seek information that helped locate a missing or abducted child.


=== Delivering Trust Website & Mailer ===
The Postal Inspection Service created the website www.deliveringtrust.com (no longer active) in 2010 to help educate consumers and provide access to resources that allowed them to better protect their privacy and avoid fraud schemes, including those conducted through the mail.  Consumers could access free fraud education and prevention videos about identity theft, work-at-home scams, Internet fraud, foreign lotteries, investment scams, and more.  The website also offered tips on recognizing scams, and instructions on reporting scammers to the appropriate authorities.  To launch the website, Postmaster General Jack Potter and the Chief Postal Inspector sponsored a tri-fold mailer that went to every delivery point in the U.S.  The mailer outlined fraud prevention tips and where to report fraud when recognized.


=== Don’t Fall For It ===
With an aim to inform and protect as many consumers as possible about current fraud schemes, the Chicago Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service took to the radio waves in 2009 with Don't Fall For It. The program featured real fraud schemes with the intent the public would hear the message and not fall for the scams. The response was overwhelming, and the show quickly became one of WBIG's most popular programs. During its eight-year run, each week a different guest was interviewed and offered wise counsel on how to protect oneself from being victimized. The show was entertaining and interactive, which allowed consumers to call in, play games, and share fraud experiences. Most importantly, Don't Fall For It provided essential information needed for the public to identify a scam before falling prey to it and informed listeners what to do if they had already been victimized.


=== Fraud Prevention Videos ===
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service partnered with High Noon Production Company to create a series of fraud prevention videos for field inspector presentations. All of the prevention films conclude with prevention tips for the public, describing how to avoid falling prey to the scheme depicted. Work commenced in 2003 that produced nine films over the course of several years covering a range of topics, including fake check scams, telemarketing fraud, work-from-home scams, and others.


=== The Inspectors Television Series ===
In October 2015, The Inspectors television series debuted — an innovative approach to consumer education and fraud prevention that used television as a medium to extend the reach of crime prevention efforts. The show's primary objective over its four seasons was to raise awareness of consumer fraud, educate the target audience about current scams, and provide tips on how they can avoid becoming victims. By socializing the nature of these crimes, The Inspectors sought to remove the mystique and the shame associated with victimization, and it encouraged and empowered victims to seek help.
During its run, the show received several awards and honors, including: 

A Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's or Pre-School Children's Series for Jessica Lundy, who starred as Postal Inspector Amanda Wainwright for Season One. In 2019, the show received a second Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Lighting.
Eight additional Emmy nominations.
Four Parent's Choice Silver Awards for “offering inspirational messages about not letting anything stop you from working towards your dreams...”
Two Parents' Choice Recommended Seals, rising above the ""Approval"" rating based on production quality, appeal and clear intent.
Recognition from Common Sense Media, who gave the show a four-star rating for family audiences.
Nine Cynopsis Recognitions with six “Social Good” Awards and three “Kids Imagination” Awards.
Twenty-nine Telly Awards over the first three seasons.


=== LooksTooGoodToBeTrue.com ===
In October 2005, USPIS partnered with the Merchant Risk Council, Monster Worldwide, Inc., Target Corporation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National White Collar Crime Center's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) to launch the “LooksTooGoodToBeTrue” initiative, an Internet fraud prevention campaign. The cornerstone of this campaign was the website LooksTooGoodToBeTrue.com which was not maintained by USPIS and is no longer active. Developed by the joint industry/law enforcement group, the site offered in-depth information on the latest Internet scams, including auction fraud, identity fraud, reshipping scams, and foreign lotteries. It also alerted the American public to scams related to Hurricane Katrina and other disasters. The site provided prevention tips to web users and an online risk assessment test to determine how vulnerable users are to scams. Consumers were able to file complaints via the site and order “Web of Deceit,” a free DVD on Internet fraud prevention produced by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.


=== National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Awareness Week ===
In a hearing before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in June 2001, USPIS representatives and the Pittsburgh Senior Action Coalition discussed the idea of having the Inspection Service and the Coalition initiate a national campaign with other agencies to raise the awareness of older citizens about illegal telemarketing and mail fraud schemes. In support of the effort, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution, introduced by Senators Carl Levin and Susan Collins, designating the week of August 25, 2002, as “National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Awareness Week.” Chief Postal Inspector Lee Heath joined forces with Postmaster General John E. Potter, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Timothy J. Muris, Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff, and representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to announce the campaign kick-off. Popular actress Betty White signed on as campaign spokesperson. More than 50 press events were held in cities nationwide, supplementing a national multimedia campaign encompassing a wide range of activities: fraud awareness posters were created and posted at more than 38,000 Post Offices across the country; brochures were inserted in Postal Service mailings of stamps and philatelic materials; half-page ads were placed in 40 major metropolitan newspapers; public service announcements featuring Betty White were broadcast on television and radio stations; and fraud awareness flyers were mailed to roughly three million households of seniors and their families.


=== Operation: Identity Crisis ===
In September 2003, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service — in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Service, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Secret Service, and various other government agencies and private companies — unveiled a national consumer awareness campaign. Known as “Operation: Identity Crisis,” the campaign focused on the ease with which identity theft occurs and prevention tips to consumers and businesses to help them protect their consumer data and ensure privacy. The campaign featured newspaper ads appearing in 17 newspapers in markets with the highest number of identity theft complaints (Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas) and sent 3 million notices to residents in the above-mentioned states. Jerry Orbach of television's Law & Order, as the national spokesman, appeared in Public Service Announcements.


=== Prizes, Sweepstakes, Foreign Lotteries Campaign ===
In 2005, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service sponsored a fraud prevention campaign in partnership with the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) to inform consumers of prizes and sweepstakes fraud and to protect the public from mailings where they have to pay a fee to receive prize/sweepstakes winnings. An overlapping campaign on foreign lotteries was also carried out to inform consumers of the illegality of playing foreign lotteries in the United States and to protect the public from scams that take their money through the purchase of “tickets” or charge money to collect non-existent winnings. Advertisements were published in magazines with a combined circulation of 14 million readers. The USPS Stamp Fulfillment Center included envelope stuffers in its mailing campaign for a 30-day period. From July – September, 2005, “Long Shot” — the foreign lottery prevention DVD—was made available through the Postal Store and circulated throughout law enforcement and consumer protection communities.


=== Project kNOw Fraud ===
Responding to the proliferation of telemarketing fraud cases, USPIS led an interagency group of law enforcement and consumer organizations in what was named “Project kNOw Fraud.” In 1999, Project kNOw Fraud sent a postcard to every household in America — more than 123 million addresses. The card contained telemarketing fraud prevention tips. The project included a website and toll-free number to call for additional information or to report a fraud. In addition, a telemarketing fraud prevention video was produced and delivered to more than 15,000 public libraries. Funding to print, address, and prepare the mailing for distribution came from money seized by the Postal Inspection Service in a telemarketing fraud case.


=== Work-at-Home Scams: They Just Don’t Pay! ===
In February 2005, USPIS and the U.S. Postal Service's Consumer Advocate office and other federal, state, and local consumer protection agencies launched a campaign informing consumers how to avoid work-at-home schemes. A multimedia approach conveyed the message with ads placed in newspapers and magazines reaching over 45 million readers.


== Badges of the postal inspectors ==
Badges were first issued to all postal inspectors in 1922 but they were prohibited from displaying them in public and to only display them in private if all other means of identification have failed. By 1945 the use of badges had become even more stringent and the badge had to be requested on a case-by-case basis. Starting in 1973, badges are once again issued to all postal inspectors.

"The Republican Party's efforts to disrupt the 2024 United States presidential election involve a series of coordinated actions intended to influence election outcomes at both federal and state levels. These efforts, which were preceded by Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election, are characterized by legislative, legal, and administrative strategies that sought to affect voter access, election oversight, and post-election certification processes. This initiative grew out of widespread claims within certain Republican Party circles about election integrity, many of which trace back to the 2020 United States presidential election and Trump's false claims of a stolen election, including the election denial movement in the United States, despite a lack of substantial evidence supporting these allegations.
Key elements of these strategies include attempts to modify voting laws, with a focus on restrictions that could disproportionately impact demographics more likely to vote for the Democratic Party. Additionally, Republican-led states saw a push to place partisan figures in election oversight positions, which may influence how election laws are interpreted and enforced. There is also a significant legal component, with numerous court cases challenging aspects of the voting process and aiming to set precedents for handling election disputes. These efforts sparked intense debate across the political spectrum, with proponents arguing that the measures ""are necessary to ensure election security"", while critics contend that they could undermine democratic processes by restricting voter access and eroding public trust in election fairness.


== Background ==
For decades, Republicans sought evidence of what they allege is rampant voting fraud in the United States. Multiple studies during this time found that election fraud is extremely rare. In 2024, an election fraud database maintained by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, showed evidence of 1,513 instances of fraud over the preceding 42 years, although many of those instances have been challenged as dubious. After Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he falsely asserted the election had been rigged and stolen from him; the false allegations came to be known as his big lie. Many of his followers developed an election denial movement to advance this false narrative. As of August 2023, a large majority of Republican voters and Republican-leaning independents continued to believe Joe Biden was not legitimately elected in 2020.
In a 1980 speech, Paul Weyrich, co-founder of the Heritage Foundation said, ""I don't want everybody to vote ... our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down."" As president, Trump falsely claimed that millions of undocumented migrants illegally voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election, depriving him of the popular vote victory.
As a result, Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May 2017; the commission was disbanded several months later, with member Matthew Dunlap, the Maine secretary of state, writing to commission chair Mike Pence and vice chair Kris Kobach that, contrary to public statements by Trump and Kobach, the commission did not find ""substantial"" voter fraud. Critics said the commission's intent was to disenfranchise or deter legal voters. Kobach, then the Kansas secretary of state, had a history of making false or unsubstantiated allegations of voting fraud to advocate for voting restrictions. The commission did not find a single instance of a noncitizen voting.
The Conservative news outlets Fox News, Newsmax, and OANN promoted false election fraud allegations in the weeks following the 2020 election, including conspiracy theories that voting machines had been rigged to favor Biden; in response, voting machine companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic filed defamation lawsuits against those three networks, some of their employees and others. Fox News agreed to pay a $787.5 million settlement to Dominion in April 2023 after it was revealed that top on-air personalities and executives knew the allegations were false but continued to promote them anyway. The 2022 Dinesh D'Souza film 2000 Mules falsely alleged that Democratic Party operatives engaged in an illegal ballot harvesting operation across five swing states during the 2020 election.
By April 2024, dozens of Republicans in four states were under indictment for their alleged involvement in the Trump fake electors plot and related Pence Card conspiracy, parts of wide-ranging efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Those indicted included Trump and several of his close associates, including Christina Bobb who leads the Republican National Committee (RNC) election integrity legal efforts in the 2024 presidential election. In September 2024, Hanna Rosin published an article about the aftermath of the January 6 attack in the lives of the insurrectionists, which mentions how they have created ""a new mythology on the right"", which could lead to a new attempt at overturning the election should Trump lose it. The Justice Department planned to monitor compliance with voting rights laws on Election Day in 27 states.
Since at least 2003, journalists, election security experts, and activists have repeatedly warned about security vulnerabilities and other flaws in the election infrastructure of the United States.


=== Historical allegations of cheating by the Republican Party ===

Commentators have repeatedly accused the Republican Party of applying deceptive methods in order to win elections. The New Republic alleged that Republican Party political campaigns have a history of applying ""voter intimidation techniques, more direct threats of violence, foreign disinformation, and super PAC and dark money skullduggery"" as strategies, citing the possible sabotage of Vietnam War peace talks during the 1968 election; the Watergate scandal during the 1972 election; the 1980 October Surprise theory; the tactics of Lee Atwater during the 1988 election; the ""butterfly ballots"", actions of Katherine Harris, Brooks Brothers riot, and Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case during the 2000 election; the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal; and the swiftboating of John Kerry during the 2004 election. Truthout cited the Volusia error during the 2000 election; voter roll purges during the 2000 and 2004 elections (in Florida and Ohio, respectively); false information about voting logistics by election boards controlled by Republicans; voter intimidation; and voter ID laws. Truthout also cited ""voter irregularities"" in Ohio during the 2004 election involving a Republican-connected company SMARTech, and also noted that Anonymous claimed without evidence that Karl Rove unsuccessfully attempted to use Mitt Romney's ORCA get-out-the-vote system to rig the 2012 election in Ohio in a similar fashion as alleged to have occurred in 2004.
In Al Jazeera America, Greg Palast warned in 2014 of the impact that the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program, which he accused of overrepresenting Black, Asian and Hispanic voters in its efforts to purge potentially millions of names from voter rolls, could have on the 2014 and 2016 elections. Palast assessed that 1.1 million voters were removed from voter rolls by the 2016 election, while the Brennan Center determined that nearly 16 million voters were removed by states between 2014 and 2016. Crosscheck had been criticized by journalists and researchers for poor accuracy.


=== Historical connections between Russia and the Republican Party ===

Craig Unger documented ties between the Republican Party and the Russian government dating back to at least 1997, including Tom DeLay visiting Moscow to meet Viktor Chernomyrdin, Ed Buckham's U.S. Family Network being funded $1 million by Russians to influence DeLay's vote on bailing out the Russian economy, and Paul Manafort's ties to Russia (among others). Manafort had given polling data to a Russian intelligence officer in 2016. The Washington Spectator traced these ties back to a 1995 visit to Russia by Allan C. Carlson, who subsequently formed the World Congress of Families after observing commonalities between American and Russian conservatives. Nafeez Ahmed has also noted the ties between the Heritage Foundation and the Danube Institute, which is funded by the government of Viktor Orbán and is supportive of the Russian government. Paul Dans, the former leader of Project 2025, appeared on a podcast from Tenet Media, which was accused by the Department of Justice of being operated by Russian agents.
Tom Nichols theorized that the Republican Party's overall affinity for Russia and Vladimir Putin in particular may be due in part to questions about the party's long-term viability which could be addressed by ""nationalist appeals, combined with electoral fraud and selective use of the prison system"" that were modeled by Putin.


=== Republican Party and the International Democratic Union ===
The Republican Party is a member of the International Democratic Union (IDU), which The Tyee described as a global group that is ""dedicated to electing right-wing governments around the world"". According to a 1985 CIA memo, the Republican Party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan had provided half of all funding for the organization at the time. Other members include the Conservative Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom, Fidesz in Hungary (led in 2025 by Viktor Orbán), Likud in Israel (led in 2025 by Benjamin Netanyahu) and (until 2023) the Bharatiya Janata Party in India. Several of their leaders had gained political power with help from Arthur J. Finkelstein, such as Orbán, Netanyahu and Trump. The IDU shares resources with its members on ""campaign technology, fund-raising techniques, opinion polling, advertising and campaign organization"". The Conservative Party of Canada and the Republican Party had closely collaborated on resources and strategy during the 2000s and 2010s.
Under the leadership of Stephen Harper, Mike Roman was the treasurer and then assistant chairman of the IDU until Roman was indicted for allegedly participating in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. During the 2008 United States presidential election, Roman had shared a video of the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case, which Richard Hasen had alleged to be an example of a false or exaggerated claim of voter fraud. Roman had written in a 2008 blog post, ""If an election is worth winning, then there is someone willing to steal it.""


== Activities ==


=== Allegations of rigged elections ===

During the 2024 campaign, Trump often referred to ""election integrity"" to allude to his continuing claim that the 2020 election was rigged, as well as predictions of future mass election fraud. As he did during the 2020 election cycle, Trump claimed that Democrats would try to rig the 2024 election. Many Republicans reported to believe that Democratic Party have and continue to engage in systemic election fraud, with some being concerned regarding election integrity. By 2022, Republican politicians and conservative talk radio cable news outlets echoed the statement of former Trump advisor Steve Bannon that ""if Democrats don't cheat, they don't win"".
The Heritage Foundation has been closely aligned with the Republican Party since its founding in 1973. In 2023, the foundation published Project 2025, a blueprint for Trump's second presidency. In July 2024, Mike Powell, the group's executive director for its Oversight Project, said that ""as things stand right now, there is a zero percent chance of a free and fair election in the United States of America"", adding, ""I'm formally accusing the Biden administration of creating the conditions that most reasonable policymakers and officials cannot in good conscience certify an election."" Heritage released a report predicting without supporting evidence that Biden might try to retain power ""by force"" if he were to lose in November. Election law expert Rick Hasen remarked that ""this is gaslighting and it is dangerous in fanning flames that could lead to potential violence.""
The Heritage Oversight Project produced videos for distribution on social media and conservative media outlets that made false or misleading claims about the extent of noncitizen voting registrations. In one video that was sent viral by an Elon Musk repost, Heritage falsely claimed that 14% of noncitizens in Georgia were registered, concluding that ""the integrity of the 2024 election is in great jeopardy"". Heritage based their findings on an extrapolation of hidden camera interview responses from seven residents in a Norcross, Georgia, apartment complex. State investigators found the seven people had never registered. During the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump's campaign and its allies revived allegations from 2020 that voting machines were rigged. The claims were widespread on social media and were frequently mentioned in lawsuits filed by Republicans. Trump and Musk repeated baseless claims of fraud and ""cheating"" in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in the days before Election Day.
Claims by Trump and Republican allies of election fraud persisted up to Election Day on November 5. After Trump was declared the winner, these claims had largely stopped, with his ""election integrity"" allies crediting his victory to their efforts.


=== Seeking vulnerabilities in the election system ===
The New York Times reported in July 2024 that ""the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system"" by systematically searching for vulnerabilities. The effort involves a network of powerful Republican lawyers and activists, many of whom were involved in the attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It involves restricting voting and short-circuiting the certification process should Trump lose. The Republican strategy involved first persuading voters that the election is about to be stolen by Democrats, despite lacking evidence. After the election, if Trump were to lose, lawyers would attempt to challenge decades of settled law as to how elections are certified. The New York Times reported the efforts had ""been quietly playing out in courts, statehouses and county boards for months, and is concentrated in critical battlegrounds"". In October 2024, The Washington Post identified as vulnerabilities leading to a possible attempt at overturning the election's results the following: widespread false information, weeks-long recounts, lawsuits delaying final results, breakdown in certifying results, disruptions at elector meetings, Congress stalling the certification, and a wild card (""something new could be tried that attorneys and election officials haven't yet gamed out"").
Nebraska is one of two states that does not have a winner-take-all system of awarding electoral college votes but rather allocates the votes by its three congressional districts. One district contains the Omaha metro area, which can tend to lean Democrat (Obama won the district in 2008, as did Biden in 2020), while the other two are more rural and vote solid Republican. During 2024, some Nebraska Republicans sought to change the state's 1991 law that created its electoral college allocation system to winner-take-all and remove the likely elector for Kamala Harris. The proposal was blocked by Republican state senators; by September 2024, it was revived with pressure brought by Trump, all of the state's Republican representatives, and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham.
During the 2024 Donald Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, Trump revealed that he and House Speaker Mike Johnson had a ""little secret"", stating: ""I think with our little secret we are gonna do really well with the House, our little secret is having a big impact, he and I have a little secret, we will tell you what it is when the race is over."" Johnson confirmed the existence of the plan. Commentators speculated that they were referring to a contingent election, in which the United States House of Representatives elects the president; or a plot to convince Republican state legislatures or Republican governors in states that Trump would lose to not certify the results or submit slates of electors before the deadline, reducing the number of electors needed to win the electoral college vote.


==== Breaching and attempted breaching of voter machines ====
At an August 2021 event organized by Mike Lindell, copies of software from Dominion Voting Systems equipment in Colorado and Michigan were distributed and posted to the public Internet. Election security experts warned that the release undermines trust in election security and allows for hackers to conduct vulnerability assessments, counter defenses, ""sabotage the system, alter ballot design or even try to change results"". Three vendors dominate election technology in the United States, limiting the ability for election officials to replace an existing system. Mike Lindell stated that his goal is to remove voting machines entirely and switch to paper ballots, a process that election officials warned would be tedious, time-consuming and prone to errors.
CNN reported that in text messages to Doug Logan, the CEO of Cyber Ninjas, which conducted the 2021 Maricopa County presidential ballot audit, Michael Flynn expressed a goal to ""fundamentally change the way votes are counted at the state level"".
In August 2023, Matthew DePerno, the former Republican nominee for the 2022 Michigan Attorney General election, and former Republican state representative Daire Rendon were charged with ""undue possession of a voting machine, willfully damaging a voting machine and conspiracy"". DePerno spread false claims about the 2020 United States presidential election.
Election denial activists had spread a password that they alleged to be used in Dominion voting machines in Georgia, including wearing the alleged password on t-shirts.
In 2020, J. Alex Halderman, a computer science and engineering professor, discovered a software vulnerability in Georgia's voting machines which made it possible for hackers to change votes. While Dominion developed a patch to address these vulnerabilities, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said that the machines would be updated after the 2024 election, dismissing Halderman's findings as ""theoretical and imaginary.""
In December 2022, election experts sent a letter to the United States Department of Justice that described a ""multi-state conspiracy to copy voting software"" that was at least partially funded by notable Trump supporters such as Sidney Powell and asking for a federal investigation. In December 2023, a follow-up open letter from computer scientists, election security experts and voter advocacy organizations listed repeated attempts by allies of Donald Trump to access voting system software in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Colorado, again calling for a federal investigation, noting that the software is used nationwide. Entire election databases from multiple counties were also copied. Electronic pollbooks, ballot scanners, servers for vote counting, USB flash drives, and memory cards were also copied in Coffee County, Georgia. At least one breach had also occurred in North Carolina. In at least four cases, election officials had to decertify or replace voting equipment. Voting experts expressed alarm over the breaches due to their breaking of the chain of custody over ballots and tabulators; as well as invasion of voter privacy. On November 13, 2024, a third open letter was sent by the same organization, Free Speech for People, to Kamala Harris, warning her of ""serious election security breaches that have threatened the security and integrity of the 2024 elections"" and urging her to request hand recounts in at least four swing states. The letter noted that voting system breaches have allowed for access to main servers, tabulators and election databases for both Dominion Voting Systems and Election Systems & Software, election vendors which collectively count approximately 70% of votes across the United States.
Between at least June and October 2024, partial passwords for election machines were exposed in a hidden tab in a spreadsheet on the Colorado secretary of state's website. According to the secretary of state's office, the machines are still protected by requiring two distinct passwords for each system, which are stored separately, by not connecting the machines to the Internet, and by storing the machines in rooms that can only be accessed with ID badges and are continuously monitored by video cameras. An investigation by a law firm concluded that the hidden tab was created by an employee who worked in the office between 2020 and 2023. A second employee, who, according to the office, was unaware of the hidden tab, posted the spreadsheet online. As a witness in a lawsuit by the Libertarian Party of Colorado, a co-founder of election vigilante group U.S. Election Integrity Plan (see Election vigilante groups below) testified that he had viewed the hidden tab three times between August and October 2024, before the state was aware of the breach.
In October 2024, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced that voter access terminals (VAT) from Dominion, which assist persons with disabilities with ballot marking, had an issue with split ticket votes. She said that this issue affected Dominion machines nationwide.
The Voting Machine Hacking Village (a hacking event co-founded by Harri Hursti) at DEF CON 32 in 2024 discovered ""new vulnerabilities ... in several widely-fielded ballot-marking and DRE voting machines."" Due to the complexities of upgrading election equipment, election and cybersecurity experts found it unlikely that vulnerability findings from the conference would have been fixed prior to Election Day.
SMART Elections (a nonpartisan election integrity advocacy group that includes academics and activists) noted that Pro V&V, a voting system test laboratory, had approved software and hardware updates for Dominion and Election Systems & Software voting systems between March and September 2024, categorizing those updates as de minimis, which do not require testing. SMART Elections warned that this lack of testing for what it described as comprehensive updates risked malware entering the voting systems. SMART Elections stated that, since at least July 2024, the website for Pro V&V had error messages, and by February 2025, the site had been nonfunctional. Newsweek reported in June 2025 that Jack Cobb, the director of Pro V&V, had denied these allegations.


==== Vulnerabilities from ES&S ====
Election Systems & Software (ES&S) was founded by Republicans, was financed by the families of Howard Ahmanson Jr. and Nelson Bunker Hunt, is owned by a private equity firm, McCarthy Group, and its investors are unknown as of December 2019. Chuck Hagel was chairman of a predecessor company to ES&S, and the treasurer for Hagel's campaign during the 1996 United States Senate election in Nebraska, Michael McCarthy, was the founder of McCarthy Group. According to Bev Harris' book on black box voting, ES&S is tied to Kiewit Corporation, which as of 2004 was involved in a number of bid rigging scandals; advocated for privatization of highways in the United States; owned CalEnergy, and was heavily involved in telecommunications via its ties to Level 3 Communications and installations of fiber-optic cables underneath highways and video surveillance cameras on roads. The Omaha World-Herald newspaper owned a stake in ES&S between 1986 and 2011. The Peter Kiewit Foundation in turn owned the Omaha World-Herald as of 2004.
As of October 2019, ES&S controls about 50% of the election system market of the United States; makes most of its money from long-term maintenance contracts; has filed lawsuits when it fails to win contracts or has them taken away; hired former election officials as lobbyists; donated to political campaigns and lobbied politicians; and threatened lawsuits against voting rights activists and security researchers. Between 2013 and 2020, ES&S has donated at least $30,000 to the Republican State Leadership Committee.
Various issues with ES&S systems have been reported since at least 1998, including missing votes, potential duplicate votes, poor calibration of touch screens leading to misinterpreted votes, names missing from voter rolls, incorrectly printed ballots and outdated technology. Concerns have also been raised by Ron Wyden about the security of its supply chain, as many parts were made in China and the Philippines. ES&S claimed that they had worked with Idaho National Laboratory for vulnerability testing, but as of December 2019, those findings have not been made public. In August 2018, Kamala Harris, Mark Warner, Susan Collins and James Lankford sent a letter to ES&S asking about their stance on independent security research after the company dismissed and discouraged such research on their systems. After the 2016 election, Jill Stein alleged that ES&S machines were vulnerable to hacking and difficult to audit, points supported by researchers. Issues with ES&S machines have also been reported during elections in 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
For example, during the 2024 elections, ES&S voting machines in Cambria County, Pennsylvania had issues scanning ballots due to a ""ballot printing error"", ""[causing] voter confusion, long lines of voters, and many individuals [leaving] the polling locations without casting a ballot"". The county's election director had retired on the same day that the election results were certified. State Representative Frank Burns called for an investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of State, and had asked for records about the ballots, voting machines, testing and internal communications, but his right to know request was denied by county election officials. By April 2025, the new county elections director had found a certification document stating that pre-election tests on voting machines were successfully completed in September 2024. Burns expressed concern why election officials were not aware of this document.
The Navajo Nation in Apache County, Arizona reported issues with voting machines and ballot printers on Election Day, leading to long lines that resulted in some voters being turned away. According to the Verified Voting Foundation, all voting equipment used in that county on Election Day 2024 was manufactured by ES&S. Similarly, there were issues with voting machines on Election Day in Queens, New York, a county that also used ES&S at the time.
In January 2020, NBC News reported that election security experts found at least 35 voting machines that were connected to the Internet as of the summer of 2019. While ES&S, Dominion Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic have all admitted to adding modems in some of their tabulators and scanners (for the purpose of quickly sharing unofficial election results), all of the voting machines that were accessible online were manufactured by ES&S and located in 11 states (including Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan) and Washington D.C. Some of these machines have been connected for months or possibly years at a time. Critical systems connected to the Internet via a firewall include vote tabulators and ""the election-management system that is used in some counties to program voting machines before elections."" Other security vulnerabilities - including missing firewall security patches, outdated SFTP server software, remote-access software, outdated operating systems, exposed passwords, exposed data of registered voters, no logging of some events, hash verification issues (noting that the hash verification was performed by ES&S instead of its customers), ballot marking device/scanner ""hybrid"" systems that can be changed with fake votes on machine-marked ballots after those ballots are cast, accessible SD and USB ports, plain text encryption keys for voter data, no set BIOS passwords, disabled Secureboot, presence of bloatware, no tamper-evident seals, immediate root access, unencrypted hard drives, use of simple default passwords, immutable passwords set such that ""the same two passwords were used for every machine manufactured"", susceptibility of central scanners to vote flipping, and ""poor physical security protections that could allow undetected tampering"" - were also reported. Free Press also warned of multiple vulnerabilities from electronic pollbooks manufactured by ES&S, including the possibility of compromised network infrastructure, voting machines, registration servers, voter data and/or the privacy of votes, as well as the risk of voter suppression.
A December 2020 investigation by DCReport found that the 2020 re-elections of Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins had all occurred in states where votes were primarily tabulated by ES&S, arguing that their wins were improbable due to low or close pre-election polls. In the case of McConnell, DCReport found large vote leads in counties that had typically voted for Democrats (including in counties in which he had not previously won); discrepancies related to split-ticket voting; and issues with Kentucky voter records. McConnell had blocked legislation in the Senate for election security in 2019, the same year that his campaign committee received at least $2,000 from ES&S. A further investigation by the same outlet later that month found that multiple ES&S executives and lobbyists are connected with Republican party politicians and election officials (such as Sandra Mortham, Marci Andino and the office of Brian Kemp); that Chris Wlaschin, the former chief information security official at the United States Department of Health and Human Services during the Trump administration, had joined ES&S to lead their security team; that 40 out of 50 states partially use ES&S for casting and counting votes; and that during the 2020 election, all but three of the 25 states that Trump had won had partially or fully used ES&S voting machines. A 2021 article also noted that several Republican officials had refused to purchase equipment from Dominion due to false claims of fraud during the 2020 United States presidential election, alleging that ES&S would benefit by increasing its market share. Similarly, The Daily Dot reported that election security advocate Jennifer Cohn accused Republicans who falsely alleged that Dominion had helped commit fraud in the 2020 election of attempting to put Dominion out of business.
The Institute for Southern Studies reported that, during the 2000 Venezuelan general election, Hugo Chávez and Venezuelan election officials accused ES&S of interference due to widespread issues with the company's voting machines.
Beth Clarkson, a Wichita State University statistician, filed an open records lawsuit for paper tapes from electronic voting machines in Sedgwick County, Kansas from the 2014 election, naming then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach as a defendant. She alleged that there were statistical anomalies that favored Republican politicians in vote counts in large precincts in multiple elections across the United States, assessing that this pattern was due to either voter fraud or a demographic trend unexplained by polling. According to the Verified Voting Foundation, all voting equipment used in that county on Election Day 2014 was manufactured by ES&S.
Between February 26, 2024 and February 24, 2025, Chris Wlaschin was appointed as a member of the Technical Guidelines Development Committee as a technical expert.


===== Vulnerabilities of electronic pollbooks =====
Journalists have noted security vulnerabilities with electronic pollbooks (e-pollbooks) in the lead-up to the 2024 election, such as many being designed to be connected to the Internet, the lack of national standards for security and reliability, the lack of a system that tracks incidents with e-pollbooks, past efforts by hackers from Russia and Iran to obtain voter data, and the subsequent risk of voters being deleted from the voter rolls by unauthorized users.
They have also been blamed for delays in the voting process. As of 2018, they are used by 36 states. ES&S is one of the main manufacturers of e-pollbooks and they, along with Diebold Election Systems, had lobbied for election officials to use them after the Help America Vote Act was passed in 2002. Free Press reported that some ES&S e-pollbooks could communicate via Bluetooth to voting machines.


==== Vulnerabilities in mail-in voting ====
Between 2020 and 2024, the United States Postal Service (USPS) changed its goals for first-class mail delivery from a three-day maximum to a five-day maximum, and had raised the price of first-class postage by 33%. The Washington Post stated that these changes had little impact on the service's finances, which included a $2.1 billion net loss during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Gerry Connolly stated in response to these changes that ""any effort to degrade service while raising prices is a recipe for a death spiral at the Postal Service"".
In July 2024, the USPS inspector general published a report noting that some service workers were not following proper procedures for mail-in ballots in some places, and that some mailed ballots were missing postmarks, which are required in many states. The report further warned that some ballots were at risk of not being counted due to both current USPS policies for processing mail as well as changes by DeJoy's Delivering for America plan. Some changes were made within days of the 2024 primary elections in Georgia and Virginia.
Lawmakers such as Mark Pocan were concerned about plans by the USPS to consolidate regional hubs, arguing that mail delivery would slow down. Significant slowdowns had been observed throughout the United States as of April 2024. Some of these regional hubs were located in states such as Virginia, Oregon, Texas and Missouri as well as swing states Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin. These consolidations have been paused until January 2025, following criticism from lawmakers.
In September 2024, the National Association of State Election Directors and National Association of Secretaries of State sent an open letter to DeJoy supporting the inspector general report, warning that the USPS has marked election mail to voters as undeliverable at ""higher than usual rates, even in cases where a voter is known not to have moved"" and that ballots that were processed in some places arrived at election offices 10+ days after the postmark date. In some states such as Utah, dozens or hundreds of ballots for 2024 primary elections had arrived over 10 days after being postmarked. Other problems highlighted in the letter include ""lost or delayed election mail, and front-line training deficiencies impacting USPS's ability to deliver election mail in a timely and accurate manner"". These issues have been described as ""systemic"". There is the risk that, if mail is returned to the original sender, voters may miss their mail-in ballots or removed from voter registration rolls.
Republicans have filed lawsuits to stop states from counting postmarked mail-in ballots that are received by election officials after Election Day. About 20 states, plus Washington, D.C., accept and count mail-in ballots received after Election Day as long as they are postmarked on or before that day. As of August 2024, these lawsuits have been filed in Nevada, Illinois, North Dakota and Mississippi. Plaintiffs include the Republican National Committee, Mark Splonskowski (the Burleigh County Auditor who is supported by Public Interest Legal Foundation), the Mississippi Republican Party and a county election commissioner.
Several issues were reported during the 2024 election with mail-in ballots, including discarded ballots, stranded or delayed ballots, undated ballots (which were not counted in Pennsylvania following lawsuits by the Republican National Committee, the Pennsylvania Republican Party and David McCormick), stolen and/or forged ballots, ballots misdirected between and within states, unprocessed ballots, and destroyed ballots.
Issues had also occurred with voter registration forms, including damaged or incomplete forms and potentially fraudulent forms or mail-in ballot applications.


=== Challenging registrations, ballots and certifications ===
Following Trump's 2020 loss amid his false allegations of fraud, Republican lawmakers initiated a sweeping effort to make voting laws more restrictive in several states across the country and to take control of the administrative management of elections at the state and local level. By 2023, organizations funded by dark money had met quietly with officials in Republican-controlled states to create an incubator of policies that would restrict ballot access and amplify false claims that fraud is rampant in elections. Led by the Heritage Foundation, the groups include the Honest Elections Project, which is among a network of conservative organizations associated with Leonard Leo, a longtime prominent figure in the Federalist Society.
The Washington Post reported in June 2024 on indications that county-level Republicans in swing states might be preparing to challenge and delay their certifications of voting results in 2024. Such delays might cause a state to miss deadlines that ensure its electoral college votes are counted in Washington on January 6, 2025. In four state elections since 2020, county election officials withheld certifications, citing mistrust in voting machines or ballot errors, though they could not produce evidence of actual voting fraud; the certifications proceeded after state interventions, which included warnings of potential criminal charges. Two Cochise County, Arizona, officials were criminally charged for refusing to certify, not because of doubts about Cochise results but as a protest against other counties voting for Democratic state candidates. Project Democracy found that since 2020 members of state and local election boards had voted against certification more than twenty times in eight states. Voting rights activists were concerned that the continuing false allegations of election fraud since 2020 might lead to social unrest if efforts to delay certifications at the local level were overruled by state officials or courts. The failure of a state to have its electoral college votes counted on January 6 could result in neither presidential candidate reaching the minimum 270 electoral votes, causing the election to be thrown to the United States House of Representatives. In that scenario, the election outcome would be determined by a simple majority count of state delegations; Republicans hold a majority in 28 of 50 delegations in the 118th United States Congress and thus Trump would win in such a scenario. The Guardian confirmed that ""experts have been particularly alarmed by efforts to try and halt certification at the local level – something that could cause delay and chaos after the presidential vote in November.""

Republican elections activist Cleta Mitchell said ""the only way [Democrats] win is to cheat"". She was a key figure in Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, participating in the January 2021 Trump–Raffensperger phone call that attempted to change the certified 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. That year, in association with the RNC, she launched the Election Integrity Network (EIN) to recruit, train and deploy election deniers as poll workers in eight key states for the 2024 presidential election. In recordings of spring 2022 organizing meetings obtained by Politico, RNC National Election Integrity director Josh Findlay, referencing EIN, was heard to tell others that the RNC would support efforts to provide staff, organization, and ""muscle"" in key states. The New York Times reported that the EIN ""has done more than any other group to take Mr. Trump's falsehoods about corruption in the democratic system and turn them into action"". Gaining access to over 400 hours of Zoom meetings, The New York Times reported that EIN had closely coordinated with the RNC, four Republican secretaries of state, and a dozen state legislatures. The group was funded by multiple Republican megadonors associated with Trump, and had successfully spread conspiracy theories about voting with several right-wing media outlets and had installed activists on election boards and thousands as poll monitors and workers. EIN has also been collaborating with other groups to challenge voter rolls, including VoteRef (run by Gina Swoboda and funded by Restoration PAC, a Super PAC predominantly funded by Richard Uihlein) and Check My Vote. EIN has also been collaborating with the Election Transparency Initiative, headed by Ken Cuccinelli. The Pennsylvania Department of State described these voter registration challenges as ""an attempt to circumvent the list maintenance processes that are carefully prescribed by state and federal law,"" which would result in ""disenfranchisement, unnecessary litigation, and a harassing diversion of already-stretched county resources.""
The Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) is a bipartisan nonprofit that helps elections officials in some 30 states manage their registration rolls with the use of software to maintain election integrity. In 2022, ERIC faced criticism from election deniers and right-wing media after the far-right blog The Gateway Pundit published a series of stories falsely suggesting it is part of a left-wing election conspiracy funded by George Soros to register Democrats. Several Republican-controlled states soon severed their association with ERIC. Members of the EIN had lobbied to have the system removed, and their activism was publicized by The Gateway Pundit and other right-wing media outlets. To supplant ERIC, Mitchell led an effort to deploy the EagleAI NETwork election software in the 2024 presidential election. NBC News reported in August 2023 that ""election experts and voting rights advocates warn that an activist-led strategy risks overwhelming election workers with reports of problem registrations generated by amateurs using unreliable data. And those reports may, in turn, intimidate voters or require them to jump through hoops to maintain their voting rights."" After months of testing, by July 2024 some conservative activists found the EagleAI system was unreliable. The Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law called EagleAI ""a vehicle to disenfranchise voters and spread disinformation"". The Associated Press reported in June 2024 that EagleAI ""is funded and used by supporters of Trump, some of whom worked to overturn the 2020 vote, and entwined with the Republican's campaign."" AP reported EagleAI was pursuing deployment in several states, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada and Ohio. During an internal meeting about the system, Cleta Mitchell said, ""The left will hate this — hate this. But we love it."" Despite its name, the software does not employ artificial intelligence, and though it is pronounced ""eagle eye"", its creator denied it was named after Operation Eagle Eye, a 1960s Republican Party voter suppression effort. As of July 2024, at least one county in Georgia signed a contract to use EagleAI for voter roll maintenance.
EagleAI is funded by Ziklag, an American Christian organization which includes the Uihlein family and whose goals include as part of ""Operation Checkmate"": ""[securing] 10,640 additional unique votes in Arizona (mirroring the 2020 margin of 10,447 votes), and [removing] up to one million ineligible registrations and around 280,000 ineligible voters in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Wisconsin."" Citizen AG, a group self-described as part of Operation Checkmate, announced its intention to file lawsuits against counties that do not accept voter challenges from EagleAI. Ziklag also funded an effort by the American Legislative Exchange Council to share talking points about ""election integrity"" with Republican party state lawmakers in 2022. Ziklag has also funded right-wing Christian groups and televangelists such as Lance Wallnau to increase turnout of evangelical voters for Trump, especially in swing states.
Julie Adams, an EIN regional coordinator, sits on the Fulton County, Georgia, elections board and has promoted the use of EagleAI in Georgia. In May 2024, she abstained from certifying the recent county primary results, though no issues of error or misconduct had been raised. State law says that election boards ""shall"" certify elections if no problems were identified; the four other board members voted to certify. Adams started a lawsuit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute (AFPI), seeking a court ruling to grant election board members more discretion in certifications. Congresswoman and Georgia Democratic Party chair Nikema Williams alleged that Adams was attempting to set the stage to block certification of results in the November presidential election. Fulton is the most populous county in Georgia with a plurality of Black residents. A Fulton County superior court judge ruled against Adams in October 2024, finding that her actions were unconstitutional and violated state law. The legal arm of AFPI was led by former Florida attorney general and Trump attorney Pam Bondi who filed voting lawsuits in battleground states.
Omega4America, initially funded by Mike Lindell, has been promoted by election denial activists as a potential replacement for ERIC. The program has been touted by those activists as being computationally faster, but election experts have cautioned that, without motor vehicle department data, its reliability would be compromised.
In August 2024, the Trump-aligned majority of the Georgia State Election Board approved a new rule allowing county election boards, before certifying their election results, to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" to verify the results are ""a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in that election""; another vote days later required that county election officials be given ""all election related documentation"" before certification. Opponents asserted the new rules violated state law and more than a century of state court precedent, and might lead to post-election delays or rejections of certifications in an important swing state. During a campaign rally three days before the board vote, Trump called out by name the three board members who later approved the rule, describing them as ""pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory"". One of them was in the rally audience and stood for recognition of Trump's praise. On August 26, Republican Georgia governor Brian Kemp said he had asked Republican Georgia attorney general Chris Carr if the governor had the authority to remove election board members, citing ethics concerns expressed by some. That same day, national and state Democrats filed a suit alleging the rules changes were illegal and would create chaos. The board majority also approved a rule in September requiring all counties to hand-count their ballots for comparison to machine counts, which critics said might cause errors and confusion while also disrupting the custody of ballots, which typically remain sealed unless a recount is demanded in a challenged election. The recounts could also significantly delay the reporting of election results. In October 2024, a Fulton County superior court judge temporarily blocked the board's hand counting rule, finding it was ""too much, too late"" to implement in the 2024 election. The next day, another Fulton County superior court judge found that seven new rules established by the State Election Board were ""illegal, unconstitutional and void"", ordering the Georgia State Election Board to inform all state and local election officials that the rules were to be disregarded. An appeal of the latter ruling by the RNC was unanimously rejected by the Georgia Supreme Court days later.

After joining the Tea Party movement of the Republican Party, Catherine Engelbrecht founded True the Vote in 2010, seeking to expose voting fraud. The organization has long promoted debunked election fraud theories. She and her collaborator Gregg Phillips provided the source information for the 2022 D'Souza film 2000 Mules that falsely alleged a five-state Democratic voting fraud operation in 2020. In response to a state lawsuit, True the Vote admitted in a February 2024 court filing that it had no evidence to support its voting fraud claims in Georgia. Phillips originated the false allegation that millions of noncitizens voted in the 2016 presidential election. For the 2024 election, they introduced IV3, a software program which they claim compares U.S. Postal Service information to voter rolls so that anyone can challenge registrations. A Wired examination found the system unreliable, although Phillips said an updated version was rolling out that has close to ""100 billion data elements about every single voter in the United States"". According to Catherine Engelbrecht, as of July 2024, IV3 has logged more than 700,000 challenges of voter registrations. As of April 2024, Gregg Phillips was also developing Ground Fusion, software ""aimed at organizations and PACs looking to identify voting irregularities across larger geographic regions."" The America Project, founded in 2021 by Michael Flynn and Patrick Byrne, said it would roll out ""state-of-the-art election tools"" that would include artificial intelligence.
In 2024, True the Vote launched VoteAlert, a social media application that allows users to report examples of what they perceive to be voter fraud. Wired had criticized a test version of the app for promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about the election. An election worker from Riverside County, California that was using the app claimed to demand identification from voters that she perceived as non-citizens, a plot that Wired described as ""racist and illegal"". As of November 2024, election workers from the county were investigating the incident.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained months of emails among elections officials in at least five Georgia counties calling themselves the Georgia Election Integrity Coalition. The Guardian reported the communications included a ""who's who of Georgia election denialists"" who were ""coordinating on policy and messaging to both call the results of November's election into question before a single vote is cast, and push rules and procedures favored by the election denial movement."" Some officials had ties to national groups like Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Network led by Cleta Mitchell. By October 2024, Republicans were filing lawsuits in battleground states alleging potential fraud to challenge mail-in ballots received from American citizens living abroad. They sought to have certain ballots set aside until voter eligibility could be verified. With about 6.5 million eligible American voters living overseas, including hundreds of thousands of military personnel, the overseas vote was long considered sacrosanct by both parties, historically giving Republicans a voting edge but more recently that advantage had diminished or swung to Democrats. Judges in Michigan and North Carolina rejected RNC suits, ruling they were an ""attempt to disenfranchise"" voters and had ""presented no substantial evidence"" of fraud. Republican congressman Scott Perry played a key role among Republican House members in efforts to overturn Biden's election in 2020. He and five other Pennsylvania representatives filed suit in their state asserting that verification of overseas ballots was insufficient to protect the election from foreign interference. Perry said he ""joined my colleagues to defend our election against the intrusion and interference of the greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world: Iran."" Pennsylvania federal judge Christopher Conner dismissed the suit in October 2024, citing its ""phantom fears of foreign malfeasance"".
Gina Swoboda filed a lawsuit attempting to remove at least 500,000 registered voters from the voting rolls in Arizona. She was joined by Steve Gaynor and Scot Mussi, the president of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, a group that has received funding from the Koch brothers, and had filed a separate lawsuit against the Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes over rules against voter intimidation.
The RNC, Trump campaign and Michigan Republican Party filed a lawsuit against government officials in Michigan over the state expanding voter registration sites to offices of the Small Business Administration and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
Republicans have also filed lawsuits attempting to limit the right to vote for convicted felons.
In October 2024, the United States Supreme Court upheld the state of Virginia's attempts to purge 1,600 registered voters from the voter rolls.
Republican politicians have discouraged electronic signatures for voter registration, filed lawsuits to prevent the use of university digital IDs for voting, directed restrictions on ballot drop boxes and proposed eliminating drop boxes altogether.


==== Election vigilante groups ====
The Election Integrity Act of 2021 in Georgia (SB 202) allows persons to file an unlimited number of challenges to voter registrations in the state. As of November 2022, at least 149,168 challenges have been filed, primarily against young or Black voters, and no charges of voter fraud have been made. These lists of challenges have been created by True the Vote, which claimed to partially obtain them from the National Change of Address registry. Brad Raffensperger stated that ""though federal law restricts our ability to update our voter registration lists, the Elector Challenge is a vehicle under our law to ensure voter integrity."" Bee Nguyen accused the law of bypassing the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which forbids voter registration purges 90 days prior to an election. SB 202 in turn potentially violates that federal law as well as the Civil Rights Act and Ku Klux Klan Act.
By July 2024, conservative groups were systematically challenging large numbers of voter registrations across the country. Many of these efforts were driven by lawsuits, including from the RNC, and activists calling themselves election investigators. The groups' stated rationale was to purge voter rolls of dead people, noncitizens and others ineligible to vote. Several Republican secretaries of state were also examining the rolls themselves. The executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors said many of the challenges ignore or misunderstand the complexity and legal requirements involved in maintaining the rolls. Others said the efforts risked disenfranchising eligible voters and sowing distrust in the election system. The Michigan secretary of state had earlier in the year directed a suburban Detroit clerk to reinstate about 1,000 registrations of eligible voters that had been purged. The New York Times reported ""it is difficult to know precisely how many voters have been dropped from the rolls as a result of the campaign — and even harder to determine how many were dropped in error.""
In October 2024, investigative journalist Greg Palast published to YouTube a documentary, Vigilantes Inc., detailing voter suppression by ""vigilante"" challenges by self-appointed vote-fraud hunters, not government officials, who are targeting people to challenge and block the counting of their ballots. Many challenges disproportionately impacted Black, young, and unhoused people, as well as students, immigrants, and lower income voters. Some of the vigilante challenge groups, such as Soles to the Rolls in Michigan or the Pigpen Project in Nevada, are connected to Cleta Mitchell, True the Vote, Mike Lindell or EagleAI. The work of these challengers was publicized by websites such as the Federalist and the Gateway Pundit, who had joined meetings organized by the Election Integrity Network. Several voters were challenged over typos in their addresses. In Michigan, a Republican party official led a ""field investigation"" by visiting multiple homes to check voter registration. In at least one case, vigilantism over a false claim of voter fraud had led to violence. The following is a table of known groups of vigilante activists:

A 2023 ProPublica article reported that James O'Keefe was part of a group analyzing federal campaign data for ""oddities"" and that he has a media company enlisting ""citizen journalists"" to investigate election fraud.
In January 2024, two people (one who heads two ""election integrity"" groups and another who ran as a volunteer for the Anne Arundel County Republican Central Committee in 2022) sued the Maryland State Board of Elections for access to state voter records. They were represented by the group Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections (RITE), which was founded in 2022 by William Barr, Karl Rove, Steve Wynn, and Bobby Burchfield (a lawyer for the RNC and Trump's 2020 election campaign who represented their efforts to halt mail-in ballots in North Carolina during that election).
As of August 2024, 40,000 vigilante activists from True the Vote had challenged 851,381 American voters in 43 states, almost all of whom were voters of color. The group's goal was to challenge 2 million voters by November 5.


=== Attacking voting rights groups ===
In August 2024, under the direction of Ken Paxton, Texas state authorities raided the homes of Hispanic campaign volunteers from the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), as part of an investigation into alleged ""election fraud and vote harvesting"". Those who supported the volunteers characterized the raids as an attempt to suppress the Hispanic vote, and LULAC asked the United States Justice Department to investigate.


=== Allegations of noncitizens voting ===

A surge of migrants crossed the southern United States border beginning in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and many of his allies alleged the Biden administration was intentionally welcoming migrants into the country so they could register and vote for Democratic candidates. Cleta Mitchell was instrumental in spreading this conspiracy theory nationwide by hosting Zoom calls advising volunteers to spread it. Many volunteers repeated rumors and conspiracies that NGOs aligned with Democrats were registering migrants to vote. Fox News host Maria Bartiromo told her X (formerly Twitter) followers that a friend of a friend told her they had seen tables set up outside Texas DMV offices to register migrants, though a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman said ""none of it is true"". Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and organizations such as Tea Party Patriots and the Election Transparency Initiative, the latter led by former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, also advanced these false narratives. Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center, said during an August congressional hearing that he believed the false narratives were created ""to set the stage for undermining the legitimacy of the 2024 election this year. The Big Lie is being pre-deployed."" Lies about noncitizen voting have become the main focus of election denialism ahead of the 2024 election, which some experts say have been used to intimidate and suppress voters while laying the groundwork to try and overturn the election again, should Trump lose.
The New York Times reported in September 2024 that ""the notion that [noncitizens] will flood the polls — and vote overwhelmingly for Democrats — is animating a sprawling network of Republicans who mobilized around"" Trump after he claimed the 2020 election was rigged, and ""the false theories about widespread noncitizen voting could be used to dispute the outcome again."" The Heritage Foundation was particularly instrumental in spreading the false narrative. Appearing with Trump in April 2024, House speaker Mike Johnson baselessly suggested ""potentially hundreds of thousands of votes"" might be cast by undocumented migrants; as president, Trump falsely asserted that millions of votes cast by undocumented migrants had deprived him of a popular vote victory in the 2016 election. States have found very few noncitizens on their voting rolls, and in the extremely rare instances of votes cast by noncitizens, they are legal immigrants who are often mistaken that they have a right to vote. An April 2024 Cato Institute review of the Heritage Foundation election fraud database found 85 irregularities involving noncitizens over the preceding 22 years.
Elon Musk, owner of X, has used his account with 197 million followers to post false or misleading information about the election, notably the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, contending Democrats are intentionally ""importing"" undocumented migrants to vote. In one case, Musk reposted a false claim that as many as two million noncitizens had been registered to vote in three states. Analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that during the first seven months of 2024, fifty false or misleading Musk posts about the election generated 1.2 billion views; independent fact-checkers debunked the posts, though the Community Notes user-generated fact check feature on X did not note them. Musk endorsed Trump in July 2024.


=== Monitoring of polling places in Democratic districts ===
Politico reported in June 2022 that the RNC sought to deploy an ""army"" of poll workers and attorneys in swing states who could refer what they deemed questionable ballots in Democratic voting precincts to a network of friendly district attorneys to challenge. In April 2024, RNC co-chair Lara Trump said the party had the ability to install poll workers who could handle ballots, rather than merely observe polling places. She also said that the 2018 expiration of the 1982 consent decree (Ballot Security Task Force) prohibiting the RNC from intimidation of minority voters ""gives us a great ability"" in the election. Republicans were recruiting poll watchers in suburbs to deploy in urban areas dominated by Democratic voters. Critics said the RNC plans created a risk that election workers might face harassment and undermine trust in the election process. The Republican governors of several states said that they would not allow the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to send poll monitors to ensure that there are no civil rights violations at polling places.
Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union that hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), wrote election officials in at least three swing states in August 2024 to explain plans to monitor ballot drop boxes. Schlapp wrote the monitoring was intended to encourage rather than discourage voting. Election officials dismissed Schlapp's premise; Arizona secretary of state Adrian Fontes remarked, ""the whole thing is an absurd sham to cover up direct efforts to intimidate voters by a bunch of CPAC-recruited vigilantes."" True the Vote planned to team with sympathetic sheriffs to monitor polling places and drop boxes in Wisconsin. Catherine Engelbrecht said her group was ""mainly focused"" on Wisconsin but ""we do have a scalable program"". By 2022, True the Vote and others were seeking cooperation with ""constitutional sheriffs"" organizations such as Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association and Protect America Now (co-founded by sheriff Mark Lamb) to investigate 2020 election fraud allegations with an eye toward preventing future alleged fraud. Such constitutional sheriffs organizations contend sheriffs are the supreme law enforcement authorities in the nation. The Southern Poverty Law Center classified such groups as part of an ""extreme antigovernment movement"" associated with the American militia movement and the sovereign citizen movement.
Trump's political operation said in April 2024 that it planned to deploy more than 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to polling places across battleground states, with an ""election integrity hotline"" for poll watchers and voters to report alleged voting irregularities. Trump told a rally audience in December 2023 that they needed to ""guard the vote"" in Democratic-run cities; at an August 2024 rally, he said he already had enough votes and ""our primary focus is not to get out the vote, but to make sure they don't cheat"". He had complained that his 2020 campaign was not adequately prepared to challenge his loss in courts; some critics said his 2024 election integrity effort is actually intended to gather allegations to overwhelm the election resolution process should he challenge the 2024 election results. Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who defeated every Trump court challenge after the 2020 election, remarked, ""I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very, very large numbers of people and very, very large numbers of lawyers.""
The America Project founded by Flynn and Byrne is staffed by prominent election deniers and funds another project, One More Mission, that seeks to recruit tens of thousands of people with military and law enforcement experience to monitor polling places. The Intercept reported in April 2020 that during a February strategy session attended by conservative donors and activists, Englebrecht said that ""you get some SEALs in those polls and they're going to say, 'No, no, this is what it says. This is how we're going to play this show.' That's what we need. We need people who are unafraid to call it like they see it."" Several attendees specifically cited this need for ""inner city"" and predominantly Native American polling precincts. The National Fraternal Order of Police, representing some 375,000 police officers nationwide, endorsed Trump in September 2024. Addressing the group's board, he urged officers to ""watch for voter fraud"" because ""you can keep it down just by watching, because, believe it or not, they're afraid of that badge."" Such police activity might violate multiple state laws and raise concerns of voter intimidation. The next day, Trump posted on social media that, if he were to win, ""those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.""
As election workers faced threats and harassment, The Washington Post reported in February 2024 it had interviewed more than a dozen election officials around the country who said they were ""preparing for the types of disruptions that historically had been more associated with political unrest abroad than American elections"". This included planning to quickly debunk misinformation, deescalate conflicts and improve coordination with federal, state, and local law enforcement to better respond to harassment, threats and potential violence. Fontes said his office was preparing for worst-case scenarios, saying ""we recognize the real and present danger that's presented by the conspiracy theories and the lies."" A May 2024 poll by Reuters and Ipsos poll found some 68% of Americans — 83% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans — said they were concerned that political violence might follow the election. Olivia Troye, a former Homeland Security and Counterterrorism aide to former vice president Mike Pence, remarked that ""the potential for anger, division, political violence — all of that groundwork is being laid out again"".
Ivan Raiklin, a close Michael Flynn associate, addressed an October 2024 Rod of Iron Ministries Freedom Festival, urging attendees to ""confront"" their state representatives with ""evidence of the illegitimate steal"" should Trump lose. He told attendees he was planning for a range of scenarios following the election, saying, ""I have a plan and strategy for every single component of it. And then January 6 is going to be pretty fun.""  He added, ""We run the elections. We try to play it fair. They steal it, our state legislatures are our final stop to guarantee a checkmate."" Raiklin had previously characterized himself as Trump's ""Secretary of Retribution"" and said he had a prepared a ""Deep State Target List' of over 350 people he would go after in a second Trump administration. Raiklin claims to have 80,000 recruits prepared to be deputized by constitutional sheriffs. Asked by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on October 13 whether he was ""expecting chaos on Election Day"" by ""outside agitators"" such as migrants or terrorists, Trump replied, ""I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within"", referencing ""radical left lunatics"". He added, ""It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.""
On at least five occasions during the election cycle, Trump has told his supporters that ""we don't need the votes."" MSNBC argued that Trump was pushing for voter intimidation to handle false claims of electoral fraud on behalf of his political opponents.


=== Challenging the legitimacy of Kamala Harris ===

Trump repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election by falsely claiming she orchestrated a ""coup"" against Biden in what The Washington Post described as an attempt to delegitimize Harris if she wins and undermine confidence in the result of the 2024 election. It further noted Trump's long insistence that ""his political failures are the result of some malevolent force trying to keep him out of power"", echoing right-wing conspiracy theories and rhetoric about a deep state in the United States.


=== Blue shift and use of polling to suggest victory ===

Trump pointed to the known voting phenomenon known as a ""blue shift"" or ""red mirage"" to make baseless allegations of voting fraud. Trump frequently made unfounded claims that he is ahead in the polls and winning in deep blue states such as California, alleging the only reason he loses such states is because of voter fraud. By October 2024, Trump made several rallies in blue states such as at Coachella, California and Madison Square Garden in New York, and CNN reported that Trump believes holding rallies in blue states helps ""show how deep his support runs across the nation"" and also ""set the groundwork for Trump to question the election results should Harris win"".
In October 2024, The New York Times reported on a number of polls commissioned by right-wing firms, most showing a Trump victory and standing out ""amid the hundreds of others indicating a dead heat in the presidential election"" and that they were seen as ""building a narrative of unstoppable momentum for Mr. Trump"". It further said that the polls were ""cementing the idea that the only way Mr. Trump can lose to Vice President Kamala Harris is if the election is rigged"" and that they ""could be held up as evidence of cheating if that victory does not come to pass"". The report noted that by October 2020, Republican-aligned pollsters had only released 15 presidential polls in swing states compared to 37 in 2024, and that of the 37 all but seven had Trump in the lead. Several of the polls were also accepted in influencing the polling averages by RealClearPolitics, which were widely shared among Republican circles. The New York Times also reported on betting markets Polymarket and Kalshi as strongly favoring Trump over Harris, and that part of the surge appeared in part due to a small number of individuals betting $30 million on a Trump win, and that Trump and Musk had pointed to the betting markets as evidence of their strength. Other data, including early-voting numbers were also ""cited by Trump supporters as further evidence of his impending triumph"".
Joshua Dyck of the Center for Public Opinion at the University of Massachusetts Lowell said that ""Republicans are clearly strategically putting polling into the information environment to try to create perceptions that Trump is stronger."" The increase in partisan polls were criticized by Simon Rosenberg, who alleged that Republicans were ""flooding the zone"" to shift polling averages, create media buzz and deflate Democratic enthusiasm. G. Elliott Morris of FiveThirtyEight stated that such low-quality polls would not impact their polling averages, which are weighted by the quality and reputation of the pollster, as did Nate Cohn of The New York Times, who calculated only a small shift in the averages. Polling strategists for both parties criticized seeing the use of polling ""weaponized"" to decrease faith in the entire system. Republican strategist Mike Madrid stated that ""the main reason you float data like that is because you're trying to convince your supporters there's no way Trump can lose — unless it's stolen"".


==== Prediction betting activities on Polymarket ====
In October 2024, Trump and Musk had promoted Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction market supported by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, especially as the site predicted a significant lead by Trump in the election. However, a French national who controlled four accounts (possibly as many as 11 accounts) bet over $30 million in favor of Trump, leading to questions of whether those accounts played a role in producing that lead. Polymarket described them as a person with ""extensive trading experience and a financial services background"" and said that there was no evidence of market manipulation, with the user acting ""based on personal views of the election"". The trader ultimately made between $48 million and $85 million in profit, claiming without evidence that his success was due to him commissioning an unnamed major pollster that found that Trump's support was being underestimated. In addition, blockchain researchers found evidence of wash trading for about one-third of all volume on Polymarket's presidential betting market, as well as an inflated transaction volume on that same market.
On November 13, the FBI raided the home of CEO Shayne Coplan and seized his phone and other electronics. As of that day, the Department of Justice was investigating Polymarket for allegedly allowing users based in the United States to place bets on its platform, which was not allowed. In response, Coplan stated, ""It's discouraging that the [Biden] administration would seek a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents. We are deeply committed to being non-partisan, and today is no different, but the incumbents should do some self-reflecting and recognize that taking a more pro-business, pro-startup approach may be what would have changed their fate this election."" Polymarket said in a statement, ""This is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election."" Brian Armstrong and Elon Musk came to Coplan's defense. Coplan previously attended the 2024 Republican National Convention and is reported to be close to Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump associates.
Prediction market critics noted that the userbase of these platforms tends to be male and right-wing, which may bias predictions of those markets in favor of Trump.
Polymarket has worked with both Nate Silver (who joined as an advisor in July 2024) and Zero Hedge to suggest betting questions on its platform. Polymarket has cited Robin Hanson's concept of futarchy as inspiration.


=== Blocking federal election monitors ===
In early November 2024, the secretaries of state for Missouri, Florida, and Texas have stated their intention to block federal election monitors from accessing polling places on Election Day. The United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division has historically been responsible for enforcing federal voting rights laws, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.


=== Selective support for third-party candidates ===
Republican activists, lawyers, and operatives have supported third party campaigns, including those of Jill Stein, Cornel West and Claudia de la Cruz, with the stated goal of taking away votes from Kamala Harris.
In an April 5, 2024, meeting with New York Republicans, Rita Palma, the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. campaign director for New York, said their top priority was to ""get rid of Biden"" and prevent a Biden victory by getting Republican voters to vote for Kennedy to defeat their ""mutual enemy"" by being a spoiler and triggering a contingent election. Plans included collecting signatures for Kennedy, volunteering with the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania, and voting for Kennedy for president.
In September 2024, the Republican-majority North Carolina Supreme Court allowed Kennedy to have his name removed from the ballot in the state after he had suspended his campaign and made the request five days after the deadline. Slate noted that Kennedy had withdrawn his name in swing states in order to help Trump, as polling suggested that Kennedy's campaign would have taken votes from Trump.


=== Non-commitment to accepting 2024 election results ===
Multiple Republican politicians, including Donald Trump, JD Vance, Lindsey Graham, Ben Carson, Elise Stefanik, Byron Donalds, Tim Scott, Doug Burgum, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, when asked whether they would accept the outcome of the 2024 election, did not give direct answers or refused to accept the results unconditionally, repeating false claims of fraud during the 2020 election.


=== Challenging congressional authority on presidential elections ===

In August 2024, the RNC, alongside 24 states, sought an emergency Supreme Court ruling that the United States Congress does not have the authority to administer presidential elections. Their goal was to enforce an Arizona state law requiring documented proof of citizenship to vote for president. Robert Bauer warned that such a decision made within a short time before voting started could cause confusion about voting registrations, disrupting the administration of the election. He also warned that, regardless of whether they won or lost, the plaintiffs may have been building a legal case for claims of non-citizen voting after the election. The Supreme Court partially granted the request to enforce that law.


=== Precinct strategy ===
Precinct strategy is a political strategy - advocated by Tea Party activist and Oath Keeper member Daniel J. Schultz, promoted by Mark Finchem, Steve Bannon, Turning Point Action and Michael Flynn, and endorsed by Donald Trump - for supporters of the election denial movement to join local level committees or become poll workers. Precinct officers collectively can affect the election process due to their ability to elect party officers, influence which candidates are on a ballot, and encourage voter turnout. In some states, they can also choose poll workers or members of election oversight boards. As of September 2021, at least 8,500 new Republican precinct officers or locally equivalent officials joined in counties across the United States, particularly ones that were seen as politically competitive. Not all district chairs screen their applicants. Some of the new officers openly supported the QAnon conspiracy theory and participated in the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Schultz had previously defended the American militia movement in an article and advocated for new officers to be armed with weapons, considering the precinct strategy to be the last alternative to violence. Once empowered, some officers have attempted to push out higher-ranking officials who do not support false claims about the 2020 United States presidential election and elect those who do, with varying degrees of success. Christian right activists, alongside True the Vote and the Election Integrity Network, have also participated in efforts to recruit poll workers in swing states. By June 2022, this strategy was used by the Republican National Committee to connect new poll workers with local party attorneys. By April 2024, the Republican Party was largely controlled by the election denial movement, especially as several Trump campaign personnel took leadership roles in the RNC.
Robert Beadles, an investor of Gab, is a supporter of precinct strategy who has funded election denialists in political campaigns, spread antisemitic conspiracy theories, promoted narratives about Black American communities and COVID-19 that have been criticized as offensive, and was suspected of hiring private investigators to harass local election officials. Former Reno City Councilman Paul McKenzie filed a complaint accusing Beadles of not filing political expenses made by Beadles' PAC Operation Sunlight.
In 2021, a group of persons knocked on doors in Yavapai County, Arizona, falsely claiming to be working on behalf of local election officials and asking residents about their votes in 2020, sparking concerns about identity theft.
In August 2024, two election officials in Michigan alleged that the Holton Township clerk (a co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party who previously ran in the 2024 primary as a Republican for the Muskegon County Commissioner) did not turn in the votes from her town on the night of the primary, and then publicly accused them of losing the town's results.
In September 2024, the Center for Media and Democracy released a report identifying 239 Republican election administrators, candidates and party leaders in swing states that were part of the election denial movement. In October 2024, the RNC and Trump campaign co-hosted a training event for poll workers in Wisconsin and across the United States. Republican officials refused to make training materials public, with the exception of the point that poll workers were encouraged to report perceived suspicions to state RNC lawyers.
During elections in 2020, 2022, and 2024, several county commissioners in multiple swing states (Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Arizona), along with New Mexico, had voted not to certify the elections. Election experts were concerned that administrators could refuse to certify if Trump had lost the 2024 presidential election, potentially leading to results being decided by majority votes in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In addition to precinct officers or poll workers, many election deniers have also been appointed as presidential electors for Trump in swing states for the 2024 election, including at least 13 who participated in the Trump fake electors plot in 2020. Two poll watchers enlisted by the Georgia Republican Party had also participated in the Trump fake electors plot, while a third included the Cobb County, Georgia GOP chair who had also spread false information about the 2020 election. Election deniers have also ran in local school board elections.
An October 2024 bulletin from the state threat assessment center in Colorado warned of insider threats, ""in which people with authorized access to the election process might attempt to derail it.""
In October 2024, a precinct committeeman who was also a former Republican Congressional District candidate was arrested for stealing ballots.
Follow the Law, an organization with ties to Election Integrity Network, has published ads in swing states encouraging election officials to treat election certification as optional. Some ads disclosed that they were paid by organizations that were tied to groups to which Richard Uihlein has provided funding.
Two election judges in Minnesota were criminally charged for their actions on Election Day, one for serving in the same precinct where her husband was on the ballot for city council (who won the election), and the other for allowing 11 people to vote without registering.
In January 2025, performance auditors for the state of Utah found that election officials in Piute County, Utah and Wayne County, Utah ""failed to comply with state law and put the integrity of multiple elections at risk in 2024"", including two primary elections and the general election.


=== Strategically restructuring local elections offices ===
In North Carolina, Republican state legislators passed a law to split the state board of elections and local county boards evenly between the Democratic and Republican parties. Democratic Governor Roy Cooper criticized the law for potentially causing stalemates, which in turn would likely cause lower turnout for early voting and longer poll lines.
In Texas, Republican state legislators passed two laws that targeted Harris County, Texas (which primarily votes for Democrats), which respectively transferred election-related responsibilities from an election administrator to the county clerk and tax assessor-collector, and permitted the Texas secretary of state to take over elections ""under certain circumstances"".


=== Attacking free press ===

Trump and other Republican politicians have repeatedly attacked journalists and media organizations, including via lawsuits (including lawsuits to reveal anonymous sources), a complaint through the Federal Election Commission, threats of imprisonment, threats to revoke broadcast licenses, threats of violence, proposing laws that directly challenge New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, threats of lawfare, and designation as ""enemy of the people"" or similar insults.
Commentators have expressed concerns that these threats could make a chilling effect on editorial decisions of media outlets (self-censorship), especially if they make unintentional mistakes while criticizing political figures. These lawsuits and threats of lawsuits were characterized as attempts to punish outlets that criticize politicians by ultimately forcing those outlets to close through multiple, slow-moving damage claims. Journalists speculated that the withdrawal of editorial board endorsements for Kamala Harris in October 2024 by the owners of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times were an attempt to appease Trump if he won the election.


=== Spreading false information and suppressing disinformation researchers ===

Several Republican Party politicians and operatives have ties to websites that have been considered by misinformation researchers and journalists to spread false information, especially about climate change, prejudice against marginalized groups, COVID-19 or the 2020 United States presidential election, including The Epoch Times, The Western Journal, and Breitbart. Some of these websites had lost advertisers in response to boycotts or were banned from being shared on some social media platforms such as Facebook or Google News, reducing their web traffic. Other conservative figures, most notably Donald Trump in the aftermath of the January 6th Capitol attack, were deplatformed from social media for incitement of violence or hate speech. As such, ""Republican politicians and activists have alleged that the tech companies are unfairly censoring the right, threatening conservatives' ability to sway public opinion and win elections.""
In 2021, Republican legislators in Texas and Florida passed laws to limit the ability of social media organizations to moderate content on their own platforms. These laws were supported by Republican attorneys general from 19 states. Republican-introduced bills in many states allowed for civil lawsuits against social media companies over perceived ""censorship"" of posts, especially those related to politics or religion. As of March 2021, research has not supported the allegation that social media companies are biased against conservative viewpoints.
In 2022, under pressure from Republican politicians and right-wing activists, the United States Department of Homeland Security shut down the Disinformation Governance Board and canceled a project with a non-profit to track death threats targeting election workers.
Starting in 2023, academic and private researchers of disinformation have been subject to subpoenas, lawsuits and public records requests by the House Judiciary Committee (led by Jim Jordan) and America First Legal (led by Stephen Miller), respectively, ""accusing them of colluding with the [United States federal] government to suppress conservative speech online."" These efforts, described as an ""attempt to chill research"", have not produced evidence ""that government officials coerced [social media platforms] to take action against accounts"" as of June 2023. America First Legal's efforts had been funded by conservative donors that are allied with Trump and have spread false claims of fraud during the 2020 elections, including $27 million from the Bradley Impact Fund and $1.3 million from the Conservative Partnership Institute. Lawsuits have also been filed against the federal government by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, as well as by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, The Daily Wire and The Federalist. Researchers had been subject to increased time demands, legal costs and online harassment. Lawyers involved in Murthy v. Missouri have alleged that Jordan's subcommittee partially leaked closed door interviews to America First Legal for use in its own lawsuits, an allegation evidenced by the Stanford Internet Observatory. Subpoenas (including threats of contempt) were also sent to large technology companies by the committee, alleging that they had a liberal bias. These actions, combined with reduced content moderation by social media platforms and progress in generative artificial intelligence, have occurred alongside an increase in online misinformation and disinformation. These actions also had a chilling effect on social media companies and federal government agencies sharing information with each other, including about foreign interference and medical misinformation. Mark Warner characterized the committee as a ""concerted effort by partisan actors to intimidate and silence"" misinformation researchers and expressed concern that its actions could hamper countering foreign disinformation and interference in the 2024 elections.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is responsible for protecting critical national infrastructure (including election security), has been repeatedly targeted by conservatives and Republican politicians, including the committee. Under Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation recommended that CISA be dismantled and that it stop addressing election misinformation. These attacks had the indirect impact of discouraging collaboration with cybersecurity experts, including research that did not involve disinformation or elections. Election security researchers at DEF CON were also harassed by election denial activists in 2022. By September 2024, Director Jen Easterly stated that the agency would not request for social media organizations to remove posts containing election misinformation.
By January 2024, researchers, technologists and political scientists warned that ""disinformation [posed] an unprecedented threat to democracy in the United States in 2024"", especially from social media. By March 2024, The New York Times reported that Trump and his allies had ""unquestionably prevailed"" in their efforts to stop collaboration between social media companies, the Biden administration, and academic researchers to protect against election disinformation. By June 2024, one of the research groups targeted by the committee, the Stanford Internet Observatory, had refocused its work and its Election Integrity Partnership project had ended. In July 2024, several Republican lawmakers threatened against re-authorization of the Global Engagement Center, which had closed in December 2024 after Republicans had removed it from a funding bill. False information, including AI slop, conspiracy theories about the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, the Springfield pet-eating hoax, false claims about the 2024 United States elections, misinformation related to abortion, vaccine misinformation, anti-trans rhetoric, promotion of raw milk, climate change denial and propaganda from the Russian government had been spread online repeatedly by Republican politicians during the 2024 election cycle.


=== Stochastic terrorism ===

Between 2021 and 2024, high-profile Republican figures and supporters such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, the Republican National Committee, Colton Moore, Matt Maddock and Mark Robinson; right-wing outlets or social media accounts such as Fox News, One America News Network and Libs of TikTok and organizations such as Gays Against Groomers have been repeatedly accused of promoting or enabling on mass media conspiracy theories (including false claims of fraud during the 2020 United States presidential election), lies, dehumanization (such as anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, xenophobia and antisemitism), demonization of political opponents and/or threats of violence (including threats of assassination and civil war), all as a form of stochastic terrorism.
Kurt Braddock, a communications researcher, notes that stochastic terrorism is largely based on disinformation that viciously attacks political opponents; is significantly more common in the form of right-wing violence than left-wing violence; and the words of those accused of perpetrating violent attacks are very similar to the rhetoric of political figures accused of inciting stochastic terrorism.
In addition to physical violence, this rhetoric has also directly inspired legislation. For example, a Tennessee bill that proposed banning gender-affirming care for trans children was sponsored by legislators who credited Matt Walsh for inspiration. In Scientific American, author Bryn Nelson noted how disgust has been weaponized by instigators of stochastic terrorism against their targets.
As part of one of the 2022 break-out sessions, the Dallas CPAC conference displayed a banner across their main stage with the phrase ""We are all domestic terrorists.""
In the aftermath of the attack on Paul Pelosi in 2022, Hillary Clinton stated: ""The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result.""
A June 2024 article from Salon argued that Trump and his allies have gone beyond the indirect language of stochastic terrorism towards direct orders for their followers to engage in violence. Experts and former United States government officials had previously come to similar conclusions, with Juliette Kayyem describing Trump's rhetoric as ""true incitement"" and ""promoting terrorism.""
An October 2024 Joint Intelligence Bulletin from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned that domestic extremists – motivated by election denial conspiracy theories, immigration, abortion, the LGBTQ community, and the two assassination attempts of Trump – posed a significant threat of violence during the election against politicians (incumbents and candidates), election staff, media staff and judges who are overseeing cases involving elections.


==== Internal threats against Republicans ====
Threats have been made to political officials at the local and national level, against both Democrats and Republicans. However, political violence has been both more common and more deadly from the far-right. These threats have been attributed to Trumpism and Trump's encouragement of violence. After the 2020 United States election, and especially during and after January 6, multiple elected officials, including Congressional Republicans, have expressed fear for their lives. Many Congressional Republicans privately supported the second impeachment of Donald Trump, but did not vote in favor of impeachment, citing threats to themselves or their families. Vox viewed Trumpist threats as a form of discipline against elected Republican officials, ""to force them to toe whatever line the Trumpists want them to walk, or else."" Rachel Kleinfeld wrote, ""Violence and threats against elected leaders are suppressing the emergence of a pro-democracy faction of the GOP"".


=== Active contempt for democracy ===

In 2018, David Frum, while arguing in favor of a moderated form of American conservatism that is independent of Trump's influence, wrote that ""if conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy."" He stated in an interview that ""the Republican Party has a platform that can't prevail in democratic competition.""
Journalists and political science experts have repeatedly accused the Republican Party of displaying anti-democratic attitudes and behaviors. By 2021, several had warned of attempts by the party to overturn the 2024 election. In 2024, the Washington State Republican Party passed a resolution that stated ""We … oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature.""
Commentators have framed the party's actions in the context of supporting minority rule for itself. Examples include reapportioning House of Representatives districts to exclude undocumented immigrants and anyone under the age of 18, attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election (including the January 6 Capitol attack), gerrymandering (particularly redistricting by Republicans in 2000 and then in 2010 with the REDMAP project that was proposed by Karl Rove and led by Ed Gillespie), voter suppression laws, politicization of election boards, attempts by Republican-controlled state legislatures to remove powers from then-recently elected Democratic governors, Citizens United v. FEC, and Shelby County v. Holder. The Atlantic argues that white flight in the 1960s and 1970s as well as the rise of white suburban evangelicals were both crucial to these activities. Republican Bob Inglis and journalist David Corn have compared the resulting electoral system to ""apartheid"". The Atlantic also warned that ""if the Republican Party is in a long retreat—and that's far from certain—the withdrawal will likely be scorched-earth.""


==== Support for fascism ====

Multiple commentators, journalists, politicians such as Joe Walsh and the Biden administration have further accused the Republican Party of supporting fascism, as exemplified by its ties to paramilitary groups and white nationalism, support for voter suppression, alliances with European nationalist parties, use of fascist language and imagery, and violent threats.


=== Interference by Elon Musk ===

Elon Musk contributed at least $260 million to efforts to re-elect Trump, including through three super PACs (America PAC, RBG PAC, and the MAHA Alliance). Steve Bannon had credited Musk financing Trump's campaign as ""the reason we won."" During the election campaign, Musk had established a ""war room"" in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, believing that the state was crucial for Trump to win the election. Musk had promoted Trump's campaign to his (Musk's) followers on X/Twitter, and had spread unfounded conspiracy theories about the Democratic Party. X had colluded with the Trump campaign to block links to a dossier of JD Vance, suspending the account of the journalist who published the dossier. Musk had repeatedly shared deepfake media of Kamala Harris, including with the use of Grok-2, a text-to-image model created by xAI. He has claimed without evidence that, if Trump did not win, the 2024 election would be the last in the United States.
Academic researchers had found that, shortly after Musk tweeted his endorsement of Trump in July 2024, Musk's X/Twitter account had received a strong and sustained increase in engagement compared to other high-profile political accounts; and that right-wing accounts had higher post visibility compared to left-wing accounts during the same time period. An analysis from the Washington Post also found that, between July 2023 and October 2024, tweets from Republican politicians had significantly more virality compared to those from Democrats.
In July 2024, Jerry Nadler wrote a letter to the House Judiciary Committee asking for an investigation into whether X/Twitter had limited users from following Kamala Harris' official presidential campaign account, with Nadler and NBC News noting that at least 16 accounts had posted that they were unable to follow the account.
Shortly after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida in September 2024, Musk published and then deleted a tweet stating that ""no one is even trying to assassinate"" President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
Musk had funded the dark money network Building America's Future since 2022, and has also given money to Citizens for Sanity through that network. Building America's Future also funded the Fair Election Fund, a group tied to Musk adviser Phil Cox and supporters of Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign, which paid $75,000 in bounties for alleged election fraud claims and promised to publicize them, but did not as of February 2025. That group had also posted ads that attacked North Carolina State Board of Elections officials that delayed adding Cornel West and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the state ballot. The group's spokesperson was Doug Collins.
During town hall events in Pennsylvania in October, Musk spread false conspiracy theories about voting machines, linking voting machines from Dominion to election losses for the Republican Party. He advocated for elections to be run with only hand-counted paper ballots, stating ""I'm a technologist, I know a lot about computers. And I'm like, the last thing I would do is trust a computer program, because it's just too easy to hack."" He further advocated for only in-person voting with identification, despite America PAC supporting mail-in voting and absentee ballots.
During the 2024 election, X (formerly Twitter) released ""Election Integrity Community"", a social media feed run by America PAC that promotes posts that are alleged to support claims by users of voter fraud, ""regardless of their accuracy."" X/Twitter under Musk had previously softened its civic integrity policy, laying off trust and safety staff, including those who had handled election policy, platform manipulation and disinformation. Claims of election fraud had spread on X/Twitter with little moderation. The Center for Countering Digital Hate reported in November 2024 that false or misleading claims about the election had 2 billion views on X/Twitter in 2024 (promoted by Musk himself in at least 87 posts).
At a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 5, 2024, Donald Trump stated: ""[Musk] really is watching this whole voting process. ... He looked at some that were just shipped in, some of these vote-counting computers. He knew it before it even came in the door. He looked like at the back of it, 'Oh, I know that one.' He knows this stuff better than anyone.""
PopCrush reported that on the same day, during an interview with Tucker Carlson, Musk asked his son if they should help Trump win the election, to which he (his son) agreed. His son then said, ""We're in SpaceX and we quietly do just whatever we want"".
On his podcast shortly after Election Day, Joe Rogan told Theo Von that Musk had ""created an app"" to know what the election results were four hours in advance. As of November 2024, how the app worked and what data it used are unknown.
The day after the election, an election official in the Tulare County, California Elections Office stated that the office used Starlink, which improved ""access to connectivity"". A few days later, another official stated that Starlink was only used to connect office laptops to the Internet to access their election database, solely for the purpose of checking in voters or verifying their registration status. Verified Voting confirmed that Starlink was used in several jurisdictions for electronic pollbooks during the election, but that it was not involved in counting votes. AFP reported that most, if not all, ballot marking devices and vote tabulators are not connected to the Internet, and that Starlink had been used in elections since at least 2022 without controversy.
At a Turning Point USA conference in December 2024, Ken Paxton claimed that during a meeting on November 3, 2024 (two days before Election Day), Elon Musk told him that he was ""now involved in every battleground state, and we're going to win every battleground state."" During the conference, Paxton said that he was ""convinced that whatever rocket science thing [Musk] did made a huge difference in this election"".
During Donald Trump's pre-inauguration rally on January 19, 2025, Trump credited Musk for his contributions to the campaign in Pennsylvania, stating ""[Musk] knows those computers better than anybody. All those computers. Those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning Pennsylvania like in a landslide."" Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett questioned whether Trump had admitted that he and Musk had committed electoral fraud, while Newsweek reported that Dan Goldman urged an investigation.
Ethan Shaotran, a member of the Department of Government Efficiency, participated in a 2020 hackathon at Devpost to build software with the stated purpose of helping voters check their ballots for issues that may prevent those ballots from being counted, using street address and ballot images as input. The team wrote a Python script that used OpenCV to generate ""semi-randomized ballots that fit certain satisfiability criteria"" to test their work. In October 2024, xAI announced a team that included Shaotran as a runner-up for the company's hackathon. The team's project documentation stated that they used Grok and tweets from X/Twitter as a multi-agent system to ""simulate entire communities' raw reactions to any topic (politics, consumer behavior, etc).""
During a meeting with state governors on February 21, 2025, Trump stated: ""If that were a close election, you'd have to wait for weeks and weeks and weeks. You've got to finish fast, Brian [Kemp]. Thank you for your help. We did very well in Georgia. It was very nice."" He also said, ""I did ask Elon [Musk] because he knows more about computers than anybody, and I said, 'What do you think of the voting system?' He said, 'Computers are not meant for voting. It's just not a good, it's too many transactions taking place too quickly. It's just not', he said"".
On the same day, People reported that Ashley St. Clair filed court petitions against Musk for full custody of her son and for Musk to be acknowledged as the father. In a 2024 text message exchange submitted as part of the filings, Musk said regarding death threats to himself: ""The threat level will reach insane levels until the election is decided"" and that ""loose lips sink ships"".
During a March 2025 interview with Musk on Ted Cruz's podcast, Cruz recalled that, during September or October 2024, Musk told him, ""I don't want a job in Washington. All I want is the login for every computer."" Cruz said that this request ""sounded kind of weird"". Musk claimed, in the context of his actions with the Department of Government Efficiency, that ""the government is run by computers"" and that ""the only way to reconcile the databases and get rid of waste and fraud is to actually look at the computers and see what's going on.""
In April 2025, X/Twitter sued Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison over a 2023 state law banning online posts of deepfakes that spread misinformation within 90 days of an election with the intent to influence that election or harm a political candidate, with X/Twitter claiming free speech violations.
During the Trump-Musk feud in June 2025, Trump stated that he would have won the state of Pennsylvania with or without help from Musk. Musk responded on X/Twitter that ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" adding ""Such ingratitude"" in a separate post.


==== America PAC ====

America PAC had posted digital ads asking viewers to register to vote, but viewers in swing states were asked to submit their address, cell phone number and age, without directing them to a voter registration page. The PAC's privacy policy allows it to use this data for ""other [political] activities and/or fundraising campaigns"" such as door-to-door canvassing. As a result, the Michigan Secretary of State's Office and the North Carolina Board of Elections have opened investigations into the PAC in August 2024, while the North Carolina Attorney General's Office started to informally review the PAC. As of October 2024, Michigan had not found evidence of the PAC violating state campaign finance law.
At least 18 Pennsylvania residents – mostly registered Democrats - have received checks from America PAC Petition despite not having signed the petition or no knowledge of family members or friends who signed them up. The petition's stated goal was to sign up 1 million registered voters in swing states to show support for the First and Second Amendments, giving away $1 million to one petition signee every day until Election Day (in addition to $100 per petition referral), and had asked for their full names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. Voter registration data in Pennsylvania - which includes names, addresses, registration status, and political affiliation – can be purchased from the Pennsylvania State Department for $20. While America PAC stated that it would verify the information of the check recipients for accuracy, many of these recipients stated that no verification process had occurred. As of December 2024, about 20 complaints have been sent to the Pennsylvania Attorney General Office's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The majority of petitioners who were selected as winners of the $1 million sweepstakes were from Pennsylvania. One of the sweepstakes winners had worked on the Trump campaign between June and October 2024. Another sweepstakes winner had the same name and lived in the same town as a person who ran for county supervisor in 2022.
On Election Day 2024, Musk stated that he planned for America PAC to be involved in the 2026 United States midterm elections, ""any intermediate elections, as well as ... elections at the district attorney level."" Larry Krasner, the Philadelphia district attorney, had filed a lawsuit against Musk and America PAC a week prior on October 28 over the PAC's $1 million giveaway scheme.
Over 1 million people in seven swing states had signed up with the petition, with Krasner arguing that they were ""scammed for their information."" On November 4, a judge dismissed the lawsuit, arguing that Krasner ""failed to provide any evidence of misuse beyond mere speculation.""


==== Contacts with Russia and national security concerns ====
The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2024 that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin, Sergey Kiriyenko, and other high ranking Russian government officials since late 2022, discussing personal topics, business and geopolitical matters. On November 15, Democratic senators Jack Reed and Jeanne Shaheen asked the Pentagon and Department of Justice to investigate these contacts, citing national security concerns. Musk has a security clearance with the United States federal government, and several federal agencies such as the Pentagon, the Space Force and NASA depend on technology from Musk's company SpaceX.


== Funding ==
The National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy and The American Prospect reported that, between 2020 and 2022, over 3,500 foundations and high net-worth donors provided over $1 billion to about 150 nonprofit organizations that supported voter suppression activities. Donors included the Bradley Foundation, Searle Freedom Trust, Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Charles Koch Foundation. Public charities with donor-advised funds (DAF) that also provided funding include DonorsTrust, Fidelity Charitable, Goldman Sachs, National Philanthropic Trust, and Schwab Charitable. The specific donors to these DAFs are unknown as of March 2025.
Other known funders of the above activities include the Uihlein family, Mike Lindell, Sidney Powell, Rebecca Dunn, Robert Beadles, the Conservative Partnership Institute, The 85 Fund, Concord Fund, Ziklag, and Elon Musk.


== Legal support ==
Known lawyers and law firms supporting the above activities, some of whom were involved in the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, include the ""election integrity unit"" of the Republican National Committee, Jones Day, Consovoy McCarthy, Dhillon Law Group Inc., Cleta Mitchell, Bruce Castor, Michael van der Veen, Christina Bobb, Public Interest Legal Foundation, America First Legal, Alan Dershowitz, and Kurt Olsen.


== Analysis ==


=== Allegations of the impact of voter suppression ===
On The Mark Thompson Show in November 2024, Greg Palast said that election vigilante challenges caused voters to be removed from the voter rolls, and that the only way for voters to reverse their challenge was to physically visit their voter registrar's office with an ID proving their citizenship and residence. Some voters may have been challenged on Election Day or the day after Election Day, and they may not have known. If a voter is challenged, they may be provided a provisional ballot. He estimated that there were 15-20 million provisional ballots during the 2024 election, and that 2.7 million of them were rejected. None of the 2.7 million people were arrested for registering or voting illegally. Palast alleged that, by adding back a fraction of the voters who were challenged and/or removed, Kamala Harris would have won both Nevada and Arizona.
In December 2024, Palast alleged that at least 2 million mail-in ballots were discarded. In January 2025, Palast further estimated that 4,776,706 voters were incorrectly removed from voter registration databases (per data from the US Election Assistance Commission), at least 2,121,000 mail-in ballots were disqualified, at least 585,000 in-precinct ballots were disqualified, 1,216,000 provisional ballots were rejected, and that 3.24 million new voter registrations were either rejected or not added to the voter rolls in time for the election. He described a technique that both Democratic and Republican politicians have used to purge voters from the voter rolls: targeted voters that do not sign and return postcards, which are mailed by state elections officials and appear as junk mail, are removed. He estimated that at least 2.3% of all votes cast in the election were suppressed, costing Kamala Harris at least 3,565,000 votes, which would have led to her winning the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, winning the election by both the popular vote and 286 Electoral College votes.


=== Allegations of anomalies in election results ===
In January 2025, Newsweek reported that two election integrity organizations, SMART Elections and Election Truth Alliance, had alleged voting irregularities during the 2024 election cycle, emphasizing that the allegations were speculative and not concrete proof of fraud. Both groups had analyzed ""drop-off rate"" - the difference in vote count between the presidential race and the next-highest down ballot statewide race (such as the United States Senate) on the same day. SMART Elections found that Trump had a significantly larger number of votes than the corresponding Republican Senate candidate or major down-ballot race, while Harris had significantly fewer votes compared to the corresponding Democratic Senate candidate or major down-ballot race, and that these findings primarily were observed for the six swing states analyzed. SMART Elections further broke down the data by county and found that, in North Carolina, Harris received fewer votes than the Democratic candidate for attorney general in every county in the state, while Trump received more votes than the Republican candidate for attorney general in every county in the state. Similar patterns were observed in eight other states (including Arizona and Wisconsin).
Election Truth Alliance had observed results in Clark County, Nevada that were ""consistent with vote manipulation."" The group analyzed cast vote records for that county (defined as an anonymized spreadsheet that shows how votes were cast) and alleged that early voting records were similar to a ""Russian tail"" (a statistical phenomenon commonly observed in Russia where election results deviate from a Gaussian distribution and may be an indicator of election fraud).


== Reactions ==


=== Media ===
Media coverage during the immediate aftermath of the election focused primarily on the conspiracy theory that Elon Musk used Starlink to hack the election results, which Snopes described as ""unfounded"". Allegations from left-wing social media users of election fraud during the aftermath of the 2024 United States presidential election had been dismissed as ""baseless"", described as part of BlueAnon and compared to Stop the Steal.
Greg Palast criticized American mainstream media's reaction to voter suppression, writing, ""The U.S. media will write about vote suppression tactics during an election. But never would the media report on the effect of suppression on the November 5 vote count.""
Alternative media outlets The Canary and the Free Press called for an election audit or a hand recount, citing multiple bomb threats, voter roll purges and voting machine vulnerabilities.
Fact-checkers from PolitiFact and NewsGuard denied claims that Trump's comments about ""vote-counting computers"" were an indication of election fraud, deeming those claims as false. Similarly, some American and international mainstream media outlets described reactions to his comments as conspiracy theories.


=== Politicians and political officials ===
As of December 18, 2024, ""no Democratic lawmaker or election official has promoted the idea that the 2024 election was stolen"", and ""[Kamala] Harris has ignored pleas to challenge the result."" The 2025 United States Electoral College vote count proceeded without any objections from lawmakers.
In response to Trump's comments about ""vote-counting computers"" the day before the inauguration, Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett questioned whether Trump had admitted that he and Musk had committed electoral fraud, while Newsweek reported that Dan Goldman urged an investigation.
The Atlanta Black Star reported in March 2025 that Maxine Waters stated her intention to investigate Elon Musk with respect to his role in the 2024 election.


=== Election and cybersecurity experts ===
Free Speech for People, a left-leaning nonprofit advocacy group for election and campaign finance reform, published three open letters between 2022 and 2024 to the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Kamala Harris, urging either a federal investigation (pre-election) or a hand recount (post-election).

""Republicans lay legal groundwork for election challenges"" (September 29, 2024) by Reuters
""Trump Allies Bombard the Courts, Setting Stage for Post-Election Fight"" (September 29, 2024) by New York Times"
"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also called bullshitting, confabulation, or delusion) is a response generated by AI that contains false or misleading information presented as fact. This term draws a loose analogy with human psychology, where hallucination typically involves false percepts. However, there is a key difference: AI hallucination is associated with erroneously constructed responses (confabulation), rather than perceptual experiences.
For example, a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, may embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within its generated content. Researchers have recognized this issue, and by 2023, analysts estimated that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, with factual errors present in 46% of generated texts. Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, in their article in Ethics and Information Technology, argue that the output of LLMs is ""bullshit"" under Harry Frankfurt's definition of the term, and that the models are ""in an important
way indifferent to the truth of their outputs"", with true statements only accidentally true, and false ones accidentally false.: 9  Detecting and mitigating these hallucinations pose significant challenges for practical deployment and reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Some people believe the specific term ""AI hallucination"" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.


== Term ==


=== Origin ===
In 1995, Stephen Thaler demonstrated how hallucinations and phantom experiences emerge from artificial neural networks through random perturbation of their connection weights.
In the early 2000s, the term ""hallucination"" was used in computer vision with a positive connotation to describe the process of adding detail to an image. For example, the task of generating high-resolution face images from low-resolution inputs is called face hallucination.
In the late 2010s, the term underwent a semantic shift to signify the generation of factually incorrect or misleading outputs by AI systems in tasks like translation or object detection. For example, in 2017, Google researchers used the term to describe the responses generated by neural machine translation (NMT) models when they are not related to the source text, and in 2018, the term was used in computer vision to describe instances where non-existent objects are erroneously detected because of adversarial attacks.
The term ""hallucinations"" in AI gained wider recognition during the AI boom, alongside the rollout of widely used chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In July 2021, Meta warned during its release of BlenderBot 2 that the system is prone to ""hallucinations"", which Meta defined as ""confident statements that are not true"". Following OpenAI's ChatGPT release in beta version in November 2022, some users complained that such chatbots often seem to pointlessly embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within their generated content. Many news outlets, including The New York Times, started to use the term ""hallucinations"" to describe these models' occasionally incorrect or inconsistent responses.
Some researchers have highlighted a lack of consistency in how the term is used, but also identified several alternative terms in the literature, such as confabulations, fabrications, and factual errors.
In 2023, the Cambridge dictionary updated its definition of hallucination to include this new sense specific to the field of AI.


=== Definitions and alternatives ===
Uses, definitions and characterizations of the term ""hallucination"" in the context of LLMs include:

""a tendency to invent facts in moments of uncertainty"" (OpenAI, May 2023)
""a model's logical mistakes"" (OpenAI, May 2023)
""fabricating information entirely, but behaving as if spouting facts"" (CNBC, May 2023)
""making up information"" (The Verge, February 2023)
""probability distributions"" (in scientific contexts)
Journalist Benj Edwards, in Ars Technica, writes that the term ""hallucination"" is controversial, but that some form of metaphor remains necessary; Edwards suggests ""confabulation"" as an analogy for processes that involve ""creative gap-filling"". In July 2024, a White House report on fostering public trust in AI research mentioned hallucinations only in the context of reducing them. Notably, when acknowledging David Baker's Nobel Prize-winning work with AI-generated proteins, the Nobel committee avoided the term entirely, instead referring to ""imaginative protein creation"".


=== Criticism ===
In the scientific community, some researchers avoid the term ""hallucination"", seeing it as potentially misleading. It has been criticized by Usama Fayyad, executive director of the Institute for Experimental Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, on the grounds that it misleadingly personifies large language models and is vague. Mary Shaw said, ""The current fashion for calling generative AI’s errors 'hallucinations' is appalling. It anthropomorphizes the software, and it spins actual errors as somehow being idiosyncratic quirks of the system even when they’re objectively incorrect."" In Salon, statistician Gary N. Smith argues that LLMs ""do not understand what words mean"" and consequently that the term ""hallucination"" unreasonably anthropomorphizes the machine. Some see the AI outputs not as illusory but as prospective—that is, having some chance of being true, similar to early-stage scientific conjectures. The term has also been criticized for its association with psychedelic drug experiences.


== In natural language generation ==

In natural language generation, a hallucination is often defined as ""generated content that appears factual but is ungrounded"". There are different ways to categorize hallucinations. Depending on whether the output contradicts the source or cannot be verified from the source, they are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic, respectively. Depending on whether the output contradicts the prompt or not, they could be divided into closed-domain and open-domain, respectively.


=== Causes ===
There are several reasons why natural language models hallucinate:


==== Hallucination from data ====
The main cause of hallucination from data is source-reference divergence. This divergence may occur (1) as an artifact of heuristic data collection or (2) due to the nature of some natural language generation tasks that inevitably contain such divergence. When a model is trained on data with source-reference (target) divergence, the model can be encouraged to generate text that is not necessarily grounded and not faithful to the provided source.


==== Modeling-related causes ====
Hallucination was shown to be a statistically inevitable byproduct of any imperfect generative model that is trained to maximize training likelihood, such as GPT-3, and requires active learning to be avoided. The pre-training of generative pretrained transformers (GPT) involves predicting the next word. It incentivizes GPT models to ""give a guess"" about what the next word is, even when they lack information. After pre-training, though, hallucinations can be mitigated through anti-hallucination fine-tuning (such as with reinforcement learning from human feedback). Some researchers take an anthropomorphic perspective and posit that hallucinations arise from a tension between novelty and usefulness. For instance, Teresa Amabile and Pratt define human creativity as the production of novel and useful ideas. By extension, a focus on novelty in machine creativity can lead to the production of original but inaccurate responses—that is, falsehoods—whereas a focus on usefulness may result in memorized content lacking originality.
Errors in encoding and decoding between text and representations can cause hallucinations. When encoders learn the wrong correlations between different parts of the training data, it can result in an erroneous generation that diverges from the input. The decoder takes the encoded input from the encoder and generates the final target sequence. Two aspects of decoding contribute to hallucinations. First, decoders can attend to the wrong part of the encoded input source, leading to erroneous generation. Second, the design of the decoding strategy itself can contribute to hallucinations. A decoding strategy that improves generation diversity, such as top-k sampling, is positively correlated with increased hallucination.
Pre-training of models on a large corpus is known to result in the model memorizing knowledge in its parameters, creating hallucinations if the system is overconfident in its hardwired knowledge. In systems such as GPT-3, an AI generates each next word based on a sequence of previous words (including the words it has itself previously generated during the same conversation), causing a cascade of possible hallucinations as the response grows longer. By 2022, newspapers such as The New York Times expressed concern that, as the adoption of bots based on large language models continued to grow, unwarranted user confidence in bot output could lead to problems.


==== Interpretability research ====
In 2025, interpretability research by Anthropic on the LLM Claude identified internal circuits that cause it to decline to answer questions unless it knows the answer. By default, the circuit is active and the LLM doesn't answer. When the LLM has sufficient information, these circuits are inhibited and the LLM answers the question. Hallucinations were found to occur when this inhibition happens incorrectly, such as when Claude recognizes a name but lacks sufficient information about that person, causing it to generate plausible but untrue responses.


=== Examples ===
On 15 November 2022, researchers from Meta AI published Galactica, designed to ""store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge"". Content generated by Galactica came with the warning: ""Outputs may be unreliable! Language Models are prone to hallucinate text."" In one case, when asked to draft a paper on creating avatars, Galactica cited a fictitious paper from a real author who works in the relevant area. Meta withdrew Galactica on 17 November due to offensiveness and inaccuracy. Before the cancellation, researchers were working on Galactica Instruct, which would use instruction tuning to allow the model to follow instructions to manipulate LaTeX documents on Overleaf.
OpenAI's ChatGPT, released in beta version to the public on November 30, 2022, is based on the foundation model GPT-3.5 (a revision of GPT-3). Professor Ethan Mollick of Wharton has called ChatGPT an ""omniscient, eager-to-please intern who sometimes lies to you"". Data scientist Teresa Kubacka has recounted deliberately making up the phrase ""cycloidal inverted electromagnon"" and testing ChatGPT by asking it about the (nonexistent) phenomenon. ChatGPT invented a plausible-sounding answer backed with plausible-looking citations that compelled her to double-check whether she had accidentally typed in the name of a real phenomenon. Other scholars such as Oren Etzioni have joined Kubacka in assessing that such software can often give ""a very impressive-sounding answer that's just dead wrong"".
When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to ""Ballad of Dwight Fry"", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics. Asked questions about the Canadian province of New Brunswick, ChatGPT got many answers right but incorrectly classified Toronto-born Samantha Bee as a ""person from New Brunswick"". Asked about astrophysical magnetic fields, ChatGPT incorrectly volunteered that ""(strong) magnetic fields of black holes are generated by the extremely strong gravitational forces in their vicinity"". (In reality, as a consequence of the no-hair theorem, a black hole without an accretion disk is believed to have no magnetic field.) Fast Company asked ChatGPT to generate a news article on Tesla's last financial quarter; ChatGPT created a coherent article, but made up the financial numbers contained within.

Other examples involve baiting ChatGPT with a false premise to see if it embellishes upon the premise. When asked about ""Harold Coward's idea of dynamic canonicity"", ChatGPT fabricated that Coward wrote a book titled Dynamic Canonicity: A Model for Biblical and Theological Interpretation, arguing that religious principles are actually in a constant state of change. When pressed, ChatGPT continued to insist that the book was real. Asked for proof that dinosaurs built a civilization, ChatGPT claimed there were fossil remains of dinosaur tools and stated, ""Some species of dinosaurs even developed primitive forms of art, such as engravings on stones"". When prompted that ""Scientists have recently discovered churros, the delicious fried-dough pastries ... (are) ideal tools for home surgery"", ChatGPT claimed that a ""study published in the journal Science"" found that the dough is pliable enough to form into surgical instruments that can get into hard-to-reach places, and that the flavor has a calming effect on patients.
By 2023, analysts considered frequent hallucination to be a major problem in LLM technology, with a Google executive identifying hallucination reduction as a ""fundamental"" task for ChatGPT competitor Google Gemini. A 2023 demo for Microsoft's GPT-based Bing AI appeared to contain several hallucinations that went uncaught by the presenter.
In May 2023, it was discovered that Stephen Schwartz had submitted six fake case precedents generated by ChatGPT in his brief to the Southern District of New York on Mata v. Avianca, Inc., a personal injury case against the airline Avianca. Schwartz said that he had never previously used ChatGPT, that he did not recognize the possibility that ChatGPT's output could have been fabricated, and that ChatGPT continued to assert the authenticity of the precedents after their nonexistence was discovered. In response, Brantley Starr of the Northern District of Texas banned the submission of AI-generated case filings that have not been reviewed by a human, noting that:

[Generative artificial intelligence] platforms in their current states are prone to hallucinations and bias. On hallucinations, they make stuff up—even quotes and citations. Another issue is reliability or bias. While attorneys swear an oath to set aside their personal prejudices, biases, and beliefs to faithfully uphold the law and represent their clients, generative artificial intelligence is the product of programming devised by humans who did not have to swear such an oath. As such, these systems hold no allegiance to any client, the rule of law, or the laws and Constitution of the United States (or, as addressed above, the truth). Unbound by any sense of duty, honor, or justice, such programs act according to computer code rather than conviction, based on programming rather than principle.

On June 23, judge P. Kevin Castel dismissed the Mata case and issued a $5,000 fine to Schwartz and another lawyer—who had both continued to stand by the fictitious precedents despite Schwartz's previous claims—for bad faith conduct. Castel characterized numerous errors and inconsistencies in the opinion summaries, describing one of the cited opinions as ""gibberish"" and ""[bordering] on nonsensical"".
In June 2023, Mark Walters, a gun rights activist and radio personality, sued OpenAI in a Georgia state court after ChatGPT mischaracterized a legal complaint in a manner alleged to be defamatory against Walters. The complaint in question was brought in May 2023 by the Second Amendment Foundation against Washington attorney general Robert W. Ferguson for allegedly violating their freedom of speech, whereas the ChatGPT-generated summary bore no resemblance and claimed that Walters was accused of embezzlement and fraud while holding a Second Amendment Foundation office post that he never held in real life. According to AI legal expert Eugene Volokh, OpenAI is likely not shielded against this claim by Section 230, because OpenAI likely ""materially contributed"" to the creation of the defamatory content.
In February 2024, Canadian airline Air Canada was ordered by the Civil Resolution Tribunal to pay damages to a customer and honor a bereavement fare policy that was hallucinated by a support chatbot, which incorrectly stated that customers could retroactively request a bereavement discount within 90 days of the date the ticket was issued (the actual policy does not allow the fare to be requested after the flight is booked). The Tribunal rejected Air Canada's defense that the chatbot was a ""separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions"".


== In other modalities ==

The concept of ""hallucination"" is not limited to text generation, and can occur with other modalities. A confident response from any AI that seems erroneous by the training data can be labeled a hallucination.


=== Object detection ===
Various researchers cited by Wired have classified adversarial hallucinations as a high-dimensional statistical phenomenon, or have attributed hallucinations to insufficient training data. Some researchers believe that some ""incorrect"" AI responses classified by humans as ""hallucinations"" in the case of object detection may in fact be justified by the training data, or even that an AI may be giving the ""correct"" answer that the human reviewers are failing to see. For example, an adversarial image that looks, to a human, like an ordinary image of a dog, may in fact be seen by the AI to contain tiny patterns that (in authentic images) would only appear when viewing a cat. The AI is detecting real-world visual patterns that humans are insensitive to.
Wired noted in 2018 that, despite no recorded attacks ""in the wild"" (that is, outside of proof-of-concept attacks by researchers), there was ""little dispute"" that consumer gadgets, and systems such as automated driving, were susceptible to adversarial attacks that could cause AI to hallucinate. Examples included a stop sign rendered invisible to computer vision; an audio clip engineered to sound innocuous to humans, but that software transcribed as ""evil dot com""; and an image of two men on skis, that Google Cloud Vision identified as 91% likely to be ""a dog"". However, these findings have been challenged by other researchers. For example, it was objected that the models can be biased towards superficial statistics, leading adversarial training to not be robust in real-world scenarios.


=== Text-to-audio generative AI ===
Text-to-audio generative AI – more narrowly known as text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, depending on the modality – are known to produce inaccurate and unexpected results.


=== Text-to-image generative AI ===
Text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and others, often produce inaccurate or unexpected results. For instance, Gemini depicted Nazi German soldiers as people of color, causing controversy and leading Google to pause image generation involving people in Gemini.


=== Text-to-video generative AI ===
Text-to-video generative models, like Sora, can introduce inaccuracies in generated videos. One example involves the Glenfinnan Viaduct, a famous landmark featured in the Harry Potter film series. Sora mistakenly added a second track to the viaduct railway, resulting in an unrealistic depiction.


== In scientific research ==


=== Problems ===
AI models can cause problems in the world of academic and scientific research due to their hallucinations. Specifically, models like ChatGPT have been recorded in multiple cases to cite sources for information that are either not correct or do not exist. A study conducted in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science showed that out of 178 total references cited by GPT-3, 69 returned an incorrect or nonexistent digital object identifier (DOI). An additional 28 had no known DOI nor could be located in a Google search.
Some nonexistent phrases such as ""vegetative electron microscopy"" have appeared in many research papers as a result of having become embedded in AI training data.
Another instance was documented by Jerome Goddard from Mississippi State University. In an experiment, ChatGPT had provided questionable information about ticks. Unsure about the validity of the response, they inquired about the source that the information had been gathered from. Upon looking at the source, it was apparent that the DOI and the names of the authors had been hallucinated. Some of the authors were contacted and confirmed that they had no knowledge of the paper's existence whatsoever. Goddard says that, ""in [ChatGPT's] current state of development, physicians and biomedical researchers should NOT ask ChatGPT for sources, references, or citations on a particular topic. Or, if they do, all such references should be carefully vetted for accuracy."" The use of these language models is not ready for fields of academic research and that their use should be handled carefully.
On top of providing incorrect or missing reference material, ChatGPT also has issues with hallucinating the contents of some reference material. A study that analyzed a total of 115 references provided by ChatGPT documented that 47% of them were fabricated. Another 46% cited real references but extracted incorrect information from them. Only the remaining 7% of references were cited correctly and provided accurate information. ChatGPT has also been observed to ""double-down"" on a lot of the incorrect information. When asked about a mistake that may have been hallucinated, sometimes ChatGPT will try to correct itself but other times it will claim the response is correct and provide even more misleading information.
These hallucinated articles generated by language models also pose an issue because it is difficult to tell whether an article was generated by an AI. To show this, a group of researchers at the Northwestern University of Chicago generated 50 abstracts based on existing reports and analyzed their originality. Plagiarism detectors gave the generated articles an originality score of 100%, meaning that the information presented appears to be completely original. Other software designed to detect AI generated text was only able to correctly identify these generated articles with an accuracy of 66%. Research scientists had a similar rate of human error, identifying these abstracts at a rate of 68%. From this information, the authors of this study concluded, ""[t]he ethical and acceptable boundaries of ChatGPT's use in scientific writing remain unclear, although some publishers are beginning to lay down policies."" Because of AI's ability to fabricate research undetected, the use of AI in the field of research will make determining the originality of research more difficult and require new policies regulating its use in the future.
Given the ability of AI generated language to pass as real scientific research in some cases, AI hallucinations present problems for the application of language models in the academic and scientific fields of research due to their ability to be undetectable when presented to real researchers. The high likelihood of returning non-existent reference material and incorrect information may require limitations to be put in place regarding these language models. Some say that rather than hallucinations, these events are more akin to ""fabrications"" and ""falsifications"" and that the use of these language models presents a risk to the integrity of the field as a whole.
Some academic professionals who support scholarly research, such as academic librarians, have observed a significant increase in workload related to verifying the accuracy of references. Zoë Teel noted in a 2023 paper that universities may need to resort to implementing their own citation auditing in order to track the problem of fictitious references. 


=== Benefits ===
Scientists have also found that hallucinations can serve as a valuable tool for scientific discovery, particularly in fields requiring innovative approaches to complex problems. At the University of Washington, David Baker's lab has used AI hallucinations to design ""ten million brand-new"" proteins that don't occur in nature, leading to roughly 100 patents and the founding of over 20 biotech companies. This work contributed to Baker receiving the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, although the committee avoided using the ""hallucinations"" language.
In medical research and device development, hallucinations have enabled practical innovations. At California Institute of Technology, researchers used hallucinations to design a novel catheter geometry that significantly reduces bacterial contamination. The design features sawtooth-like spikes on the inner walls that prevent bacteria from gaining traction, potentially addressing a global health issue that causes millions of urinary tract infections annually. These scientific application of hallucinations differs fundamentally from chatbot hallucinations, as they are grounded in physical reality and scientific facts rather than ambiguous language or internet data. Anima Anandkumar, a professor at Caltech, emphasizes that these AI models are ""taught physics"" and their outputs must be validated through rigorous testing. In meteorology, scientists use AI to generate thousands of subtle forecast variations, helping identify unexpected factors that can influence extreme weather events.
At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, researchers have applied hallucinatory techniques to enhance blurry medical images, while the University of Texas at Austin has utilized them to improve robot navigation systems. These applications demonstrate how hallucinations, when properly constrained by scientific methodology, can accelerate the discovery process from years to days or even minutes.


== Mitigation methods ==
The hallucination phenomenon is still not completely understood. Researchers have also proposed that hallucinations are inevitable and are an innate limitation of large language models. Therefore, there is still ongoing research to try to mitigate its occurrence. Particularly, it was shown that language models not only hallucinate but also amplify hallucinations, even for those which were designed to alleviate this issue.
Ji et al. divide common mitigation methods into two categories: data-related methods and modeling and inference methods. Data-related methods include building a faithful dataset, cleaning data automatically and information augmentation by augmenting the inputs with external information. Model and inference methods include changes in the architecture (either modifying the encoder, attention or the decoder in various ways), changes in the training process, such as using reinforcement learning, and post-processing methods that can correct hallucinations in the output.
Researchers have proposed a variety of mitigation measures, including getting different chatbots to debate one another until they reach consensus on an answer. Another approach proposes to actively validate the correctness corresponding to the low-confidence generation of the model using web search results. They have shown that a generated sentence is hallucinated more often when the model has already hallucinated in its previously generated sentences for the input, and they are instructing the model to create a validation question checking the correctness of the information about the selected concept using Bing search API. An extra layer of logic-based rules was proposed for the web search mitigation method, by using different ranks of web pages as a knowledge base, which differ in hierarchy. When there are no external data sources available to validate LLM-generated responses (or the responses are already based on external data as in RAG), model uncertainty estimation techniques from machine learning may be applied to detect hallucinations.
According to Luo et al., the previous methods fall into knowledge- and retrieval-based approaches, which ground LLM responses in factual data using external knowledge sources, such as path grounding. Luo et al. also mention training or reference guiding for language models, involving strategies like employing control codes or contrastive learning to guide the generation process to differentiate between correct and hallucinated content. Another category is evaluation and mitigation focused on specific hallucination types, such as employing methods to evaluate quantity entity in summarization and methods to detect and mitigate self-contradictory statements.
Nvidia Guardrails, launched in 2023, can be configured to hard-code certain responses via script instead of leaving them to the LLM. Furthermore, numerous tools like SelfCheckGPT, the Trustworthy Language Model, and Aimon have emerged to aid in the detection of hallucination in offline experimentation and real-time production scenarios.

==== Endless Mayfly ====
Endless Mayfly, dubbed by Citizen Lab, is an Iran-affiliated disinformation campaign of inauthentic social media accounts and fake news websites that, according to Citizen Lab, ""spreads falsehoods and amplifies narratives critical of Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Israel."" It is notable for using a technique that Citizen Lab described as ""ephemeral disinformation"": When an article from the campaign received significant engagement on social media, it was deleted and URLs were linked to the website that the article was falsely portraying.


==== International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM) ====
The International Union of Virtual Media is described by the Atlantic Council as ""a cluster of ostensibly independent websites that aggressively repackaged and re-broadcast Iranian state media"", without citation. The network has been taken down by Facebook, Twitter, and Google for coordinated inauthentic behavior.


==== Storm-2035 ====
Storm-2035, dubbed by Microsoft Threat Analysis Center in August 2024, is attributed by Microsoft researchers to ""an Iranian network"" and described by them as a collection of fake news websites that has been active since at least 2020 and has targeted both conservative and liberal audiences in the United States. At least some of their content has been alleged by Microsoft to be created by generative artificial intelligence models to repost content from United States-based news outlets without attribution. Such outlets include The Guardian, The Week, Newsweek, and the Los Angeles Times. An investigation from OpenAI found that the network used ChatGPT to generate articles and social media comments. A network of social media accounts that promoted one of the sites was taken down in 2022 by Twitter for coordinated inauthentic behavior.

Some content posted on these sites overlaps with the Spamouflage disinformation operation.


==== Happytify network (歡享網) ====


=== Philippines ===

Fake news sites have become rampant for Philippine audiences, especially being shared on social media. Politicians have started filing laws to combat fake news and three Senate hearings have been held on the topic.
The Catholic Church in the Philippines has also released a missive speaking out against it.
Vera Files research at the end of 2017 and 2018 show that the most shared fake news in the Philippines appeared to benefit 2 people the most: Former President Rodrigo Duterte (as well as his allies) and President Bongbong Marcos, with the most viral news driven by shares on networks of Facebook pages. Most Philippine audience Facebook pages and groups spreading online disinformation also bear ""Duterte"", ""Marcos"" or ""News"" in their names and are pro-Duterte. Online disinformation in the Philippines is overwhelmingly political as well, with most attacking groups or individuals critical of the Duterte administration. Many Philippine-audience fake news websites also appear to be controlled by the same operators as they share common Google AdSense and Google Analytics IDs.
According to media scholar Jonathan Corpus Ong, Duterte's presidential campaign is regarded as the patient zero in the current era of disinformation, having preceded widespread global coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Russian trolls. Fake news is so established and severe in the Philippines that Facebook's Global Politics and Government Outreach Director Katie Harbath also calls it ""patient zero"" in the global misinformation epidemic, having happened before Brexit, the Donald Trump nomination and the 2016 United States elections.


=== Republic of China ===


==== Mission (密訊) ====
Mission is a content farm that has repeatedly published false information and republished or rephrased stories from other outlets, especially the China Times. It is connected to Lin Cheng-kuo (林正國), a former assistant for Wang Ping-chung (王炳忠), a spokesperson for the New Party. The network uses ""link wheeling"" to manipulate search engine rankings by Google and Bing, and repeatedly switched domain names to get ahead of bans by Facebook (including the use of beeper.live, a content farm in Malaysia). Mission has promoted content from The Reacher (觸極者), a site also run by Lin, and both sites in turn promoted a China-Taiwan exchange program jointly managed by the Taiwan Affairs Office, several state-run media outlets in China (China Media Group, iTaiwan News Network (海峽飛虹中文網), Huaxia.net (華夏經緯網), Sichuan Daily New Media Centre (四川日報新媒體中心)), and a private media company based in Taiwan.

==== Radical Economic Transformation media network ====
A network of websites, dubbed the Radical Economic Transformation media network by the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting and described by journalists as ""disinformation"" and ""propaganda"", promoted the concept of white monopoly capital and repeatedly and anonymously attacked Cyril Ramaphosa, journalists, opposition politicians and other critics of the Gupta family, Jacob Zuma and their associates. The sites were registered by CNET Infosystem, an Indian reputation management firm that is linked to the Gupta family, who had close ties with Zuma. As of 2017, they received nearly all of their web traffic from users in India, and were linked to pro-Gupta and pro-Zuma Twitter accounts whose posts were retweeted by bot accounts. This network of websites and social media assets also included media outlets owned by the Gupta family: ANN7 and The New Age. The overall social media strategy was analyzed by Bell Pottinger, who was contracted by the Gupta family. The New York Times noted that, due to the disinformation campaign, ""racial tensions [in South Africa] rose to levels that had not been felt since apartheid"" and asserted that the campaign significantly damaged the cause of advancing economic equality for Black South Africans.


=== Spain ===


=== Sweden ===


=== Tanzania ===
Between 2020 and 2021, a network of Twitter accounts was used by ""[Tanzanian-]government aligned individuals"" supportive of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party to harass activists, journalists, and Tanzanian opposition politicians. The campaign was possibly ""partially outsourced  to a Russian-speaking country"", and involved false copyright campaigns: Twitter content that criticized the CCM party was added to blog sites (listed below) and back dated, and then the original content was reported to Twitter under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This network was suspended by Twitter in 2021 for coordinated inauthentic behavior.

==== Qiqi News Network ====
Qiqi News Network is a content farm based in Malaysia, owned by Yee Kok Wai (余國威) and Evan Lee, that has been accused by researchers of publishing disinformation that favored the Chinese Communist Party prior to the 2020 Taiwanese general election, often spread over Line. It spread a false story that COVID-19 originated in the United States. The network was noted in a joint report by Graphika, Institute for the Future and the International Republican Institute to ""[push] a worldview closely aligned with the CCP, frequently [use] mainland Chinese phrasings, and [recycle] articles from other news outlets, often Chinese state-owned media."" Several stories and website domains promoted by the network have been alleged, by Twitter and Audrey Tang of Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs to be linked directly to the government of the People's Republic of China. At least one member of the Chinese Unification Promotion Party, Chang Dong-nan (張東南), joined Yee's Facebook group, Global Chinese Alliance (全球華人聯盟), in 2014.


==== Voice of Europe ====

"eBay Inc. ( EE-bay, stylized as ebay) is an American multinational e-commerce company based in San Jose, California, that allows users to buy or view items via retail sales through online marketplaces and websites in 190 markets worldwide. Sales occur either via online auctions or ""buy it now"" instant sales, and the company charges commissions to sellers upon sales. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in September 1995. It has 132 million yearly active buyers worldwide and handled $73 billion in transactions in 2023, 48% of which were in the United States. In 2023, the company had a take rate (revenue as a percentage of volume) of 13.81%. The company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and is a component of the S&P 500 and formerly the Nasdaq-100.
eBay can be used by individuals, companies and governments to purchase and sell almost any legal, non-controversial item. eBay's auctions use a Vickrey auction (sealed-bid) proxy bid system. Buyers and sellers may rate and review each other after each transaction, resulting in a reputation system. The eBay service is accessible via websites and mobile apps. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the eBay API. Merchants can also earn commissions from affiliate marketing programs by eBay.

One of the first items sold on AuctionWeb was a broken laser pointer for $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the laser pointer was broken; the buyer explained: ""I'm a collector of broken laser pointers.""
In February 1996, Omidyar's internet service provider informed him that he would need to upgrade to a business account due to the high web traffic of his website. The monthly price increase from $30 to $250 prompted Omidyar to obtain support from his mother's family (his grandfather, General Mahmud Mir-Djalali was the ""father"" of Iran's Defense Industries). The website made $1,000 in its first month, which was more than it cost to run, and $2,500 in its second month. Chris Agarpao was eBay's first employee; he processed mailed check payments.
Jeffrey Skoll was hired as the first president of the company in early 1996. In November 1996, the company launched online auctions for airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise berths and other travel-related products in partnership with Electronic Travel Auctions. By that time, the company had hosted more than 200,000 auctions since its founding 14 months earlier.
The company changed the name of its service from AuctionWeb to eBay in September 1997, after Echo Bay Technology Group, Omidyar's consulting firm. The echobay.com domain name was already registered by Echo Bay Mines, a gold mining company, so Omidyar shortened it to eBay.com. In 1997, the company received $6.7 million in venture capital funding from Benchmark.
The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar's fiancée trade Pez candy dispensers was fabricated in 1997 by public relations manager Mary Lou Song to give the media a human-interest story and to generate publicity with toy collectors. The most purchased and sold items on the website were Beanie Babies, the most difficult toys to find in retail stores, accounting for 10% of all listings in 1997. Ty, the manufacturer, had set up a website whereby people could trade used Beanie Babies. However, it was overwhelmed with unsortable listings. With a user-friendly interface, eBay became popular with collectors.
Meg Whitman was appointed president and CEO in March 1998. At the time, the company had 30 employees, 500,000 users, and revenues of $4.7 million in the United States. In July 1998, eBay acquired Jump, the developer and operator of Up4Sale, an advertising-supported auction website which at the time had 27,000 separate auctions and 50,000 registered members.

In September 1998, during the dot-com bubble, eBay became a public company via an initial public offering led by CFO Gary F. Bengier, opening on NASDAQ under the stock ticker EBAY. Upon the initial public offering, which was priced at $18 per share and closed for trading on its first day at $53 per share, both Omidyar and Skoll became billionaires. In the risk factors section of the annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998, Omidyar noted eBay's dependence on the continued strength of the Beanie Babies market.


=== 2000s ===
In June 2000, eBay acquired Half.com for $312 million in stock. In 2000, eBay partnered with Escrow.com to handle escrow for purchases and sales of motor vehicles, later expanded to other transaction types. By year-end, it had 22.5 million registered users and 79.4 million auctions per quarter.

On May 28, 2003, in the case of eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., which had implications for the treatment of business method patents, a United States district court jury found eBay guilty of willful patent infringement and ordered the company to pay $35 million in damages after MercExchange accused eBay of infringing on three patents, one of which is used in eBay's ""Buy It Now"" feature. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). The CAFC affirmed the judgment of willful infringement, and reversed the lower court and granted a permanent injunction. eBay appealed the permanent injunction to the Supreme Court of the United States, which on May 15, 2006 found an injunction is not required nor automatic in this or any patent case where guilt has been established. The case was sent back to the Virginia district court for consideration of the injunction and a trial on another MercExchange patent.
In 2003, eBay sought to develop its e-commerce business in China, acquiring the country's leading online auction platform (EachNet) and reaching an 85% market share.: 51  Within four years, the development of Alibaba's Taobao resulted in eBay's market share in China decreasing to 7.7%.: 51–52

ProStores' feature set included simple wizard-driven website, e-commerce capabilities, site design tools and e-business management. Smaller merchants could also manage the entire process of posting and selling products on eBay using the ProStores interface. It also offered inventory management, supplier communication and integration with Quickbooks and Dreamweaver. eBay announced on July 1, 2014 that support for the platform would end February 1, 2015. In February 2006, Intuit launched a web-based version of ItsDeductible, a donation tracking service, using data from eBay to help users assign a market value to the items they donate.

In April 2008, eBay sued Craigslist, claiming that in January 2008, Craigslist took actions that ""unfairly diluted eBay's economic interest by more than 10%"", making eBay lose its seat on the board of directors of Craigslist. Craigslist countersued in May 2008 alleging that eBay used its board seat to gain insider information about Craigslist that was used to compete against the company. In September 2010, Delaware Judge William B. Chandler III ruled that the actions of Craigslist were unlawful and that the actions were taken by Craigslist founders Jim Buckmaster and Craig Newmark had ""breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty"", and restored eBay's stake in the company to 28.4% from a diluted level of 24.85%. However, the judge dismissed eBay's objection to a staggered board provision, citing that Craigslist has the right to protect its own trade secrets.
In May 2008, eBay announced the opening of a building on the company's North Campus in San Jose, California, the first ground-up structure in the city to be built to LEED Gold standards. The building, the first the company had built in its 13-year existence, uses an array of 3,248 solar panels, spanning 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2), and providing 650 kilowatts of power, 15–18% of the company's total energy requirements, reducing carbon dioxide usage by 37 million pounds over 30 years.

=== Financial history ===


== Philanthropy and charity auctions ==
Using MissionFish as an arbiter, eBay allows sellers to donate a portion of their auction proceeds to a charity of the seller's choice and charges discounted fees for charity auctions.
High-profile charity auctions facilitated via eBay include the ""Power Lunch"" with investor Warren Buffett for 8 people at the Smith & Wollensky restaurant in New York City, with all of the proceeds going to the Glide Foundation. Auctions were held annually in 21 years between 2000 and 2022, with no auctions in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, auctions on eBay for lunch with Buffett raised $53.2 million for the Glide Foundation, with winning bids ranging from $2 million to as high as $19 million for the final auction in 2022. In May 2024, a charity auction for lunch with Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, raised $200,000 plus an additional donation of $1.5 million for the Glide Foundation.
Also benefitting charity, a letter sent to Mark P. Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications by Senator Harry Reid and forty other Democratic senators, complaining about comments made by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, sold for $2,100,100, with all of the proceeds going to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, benefiting the education of children of men and women who have died serving in the armed forces. The winning bid was matched by Limbaugh.
In 2022, more than $163 million was raised for charities via the platform.


== Stalking scandal ==

In June 2020, five employees were terminated and were subject to charges of cyberstalking after they were accused of targeting Ina and David Steiner, the editors and publishers of EcommerceBytes, a newsletter that eBay executives viewed as critical of the company. In addition to sending harassing messages and doxing, the defendants ""ordered anonymous and disturbing deliveries to the victims' home, including a preserved fetal pig, a bloody pig Halloween mask, a funeral wreath, a book on surviving the loss of a spouse, and pornography"". The defendants also vandalized the couple's home in Natick, Massachusetts. The conspirators pleaded guilty and most were sentenced to prison terms. Wenig, the company's CEO at the time of the harassment campaign, who was frequently targeted by the newsletter, was found by investigators to not have any knowledge about the harassment activities and was not charged.  He left the company in September 2019 with a $57 million severance package. Steve Wymer, chief communication officer, who had ties with local politicians, was fired ""for cause"" for alleged involvement but was not charged and was hired by the local chapter of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.


== Criticisms and controversies ==


=== Fraud ===
Fraud committed by sellers includes selling counterfeit merchandise / bootleg recordings, shill bidding (undisclosed vendor bidding that is used to artificially inflate the price of a certain item by either the seller under an alternate account or another person in collusion with the seller), receiving payment and not shipping merchandise, shipping items other than those described, giving a deliberately misleading description or photo, knowingly and deliberately shipping faulty merchandise, denying warranty exchange after pre-agreeing to return merchandise authorization of defective on arrival merchandise, knowingly fencing (selling stolen goods), misrepresenting the cost of shipping, using bulk shipping prices to knowingly mask much higher costing, individual return shipping, and using pseudo-accounts to make high nonpaying bids on similar items that competitors are selling. eBay has been criticized for not doing enough to combat shill bidding. There are techniques such as auction sniping, which let buyers avoid shill bidders.
Fraud committed by buyers includes filing a false shipping damage claim with the shipping company, friendly fraud (receiving merchandise and claiming otherwise), returning items other than received, removing parts from an item and returning it for a refund, sending a forged payment-service e-mail that states that he or she has made a payment to the seller's account as proof of payment, making a low bid then using pseudo-accounts to make high nonpaying bids in an attempt at gaining a low second chance offer price, damaging a non-refundable item to get a refund by claiming that the seller sent the item already damaged (in cases of buyer's remorse), and a package redirection scam, in which the return package is filled with garbage and sent to the wrong address.
In 2004, Tiffany & Co. filed a lawsuit against eBay claiming that over 70% of the Tiffany silver jewelry offered for sale on eBay was fake and that eBay profited from the sales of counterfeit Tiffany items that infringed on its trademark. On July 14, 2008, a Federal District Court judge ruled that eBay does not have a legal responsibility to monitor users selling counterfeit items. In 2010, the Second Circuit affirmed this decision in Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc.
In June 2008, a court in Paris awarded damages of €40 million to LVMH over eBay auctions of counterfeit bags, perfumes, and other items sold by non-authorized retailers and entered a permanent injunction against eBay auctions of LVMH perfumes, whether counterfeit or not. eBay banned such items from its site. Also that month, a court in Troyes, France, awarded eBay to pay luxury goods maker Hermès €20,000 due to the sale of two counterfeit bags on eBay in 2006. The court also ordered eBay to post the ruling on the home page of eBay's French website for three months.


==== Items stolen from the British Museum ====
Items stolen from the British Museum in 2013 were auctioned on eBay in 2016. The museum reported that several items of jewelry made of gold, semi-precious stones, and glass, dating from between 1,500 BC and the 19th century AD, were among those missing. One piece of ancient Roman jewelry made from onyx – valued between £25,000 and £50,000, or US$32,000 and US$63,000 – was listed on eBay with a minimum price of £40 (US$50) in 2016. There were no bids made for the treasure. The police are investigating this case. The company said that it is supports local police in investigations and removes listings containing stolen property.


==== Dr. Seuss books ====
In 2021, the estate of Dr. Seuss requested from eBay, and the company complied, to ban the sale of six Dr. Seuss books due to concerns that some images contained therein were racially insensitive. This led to backlash from followers of right-wing politics and ignited a surge of interest in the discontinued books.


=== Sale of illegal items ===
In September 2023, the United States Department of Justice sued eBay, accusing it of violating the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws by allowing the sale of several illegal products, including devices that defeat automobile pollution controls, restricted-use pesticides, and paint and coating removal products containing methylene chloride.


=== Port scanning ===
In 2020, developer Dan Nemec discovered that eBay was port scanning its users using LexisNexis' ThreatMetrix product to detect remote access. The port scanning was performed using obfuscated client-side JavaScript which attempts to open WebSocket connections to localhost on ports commonly used by remote access tools like VNC.

Business data for eBay Inc:"
"Private browsing (also known as incognito mode or private mode) is a feature in most web browsers that enhances user privacy. In this mode, the browser initiates a temporary session separate from its main session and user data. The browsing history is not recorded, and local data related to the session, like Cookies and Web cache, are deleted once the session ends. The primary purpose of these modes is to ensure that data and history from a specific browsing session do not remain on the device or get accessed by another user of the same device. In web development, it can be used to quickly test displaying pages as they appear to first-time visitors.
Private browsing modes do not necessarily protect users from being tracked by other websites or their Internet service provider (ISP). Furthermore, there is a possibility that identifiable traces of activity could be leaked from private browsing sessions by means of the operating system, security flaws in the browser, or via malicious browser extensions, and it has been found that certain HTML5 APIs can be used to detect the presence of private browsing modes due to differences in behavior. This is usually why some people mistake private browsing for a virtual private network.


== History ==
Apple's Safari browser was one of the first major web browsers to include this feature, first introduced in April 2005. The feature was subsequently adopted by other browsers, leading to the popularization of the term in 2008 by mainstream news outlets and computing websites during discussions about the beta versions of Internet Explorer 8. Adobe Flash Player 10.1 started respecting browser settings and private browsing modes in relation to storing local shared objects.


== Uses ==
Private browsing modes are commonly used for various purposes, such as concealing visits to sensitive websites (like adult-oriented content) from the browsing history, conducting unbiased web searches unaffected by previous browsing habits or recorded interests, offering a ""clean"" temporary session for guest users (for instance, on public computers), and managing multiple accounts on websites simultaneously. Private browsing can also be used to circumvent metered paywalls on some websites.
In a survey conducted by DuckDuckGo, 48% of participants chose not to respond, prompting lead researcher Elie Bursztein to observe, ""Surveys are clearly not the best approach to understand why people use private browsing mode due to the embarrassment factor."" Additionally, 18% of respondents indicated that their main use of private browsing modes was for online shopping.
A study by the Mozilla Foundation found that most sessions lasted only about 10 minutes. However, there were periods of increased activation, usually from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., at 5 p.m., between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., and a minor peak occurred about an hour or two after midnight.


== Support in popular browsers ==
Private browsing is known by different names in different browsers.


== Security ==
It is a common misconception that private browsing modes can protect users from being tracked by other websites or their Internet service provider (ISP). Such entities can still use information such as IP addresses and user accounts to uniquely identify users. Private browsers on iOS, not created by Apple, must adhere to specific standards and regulations to be available on its platform for iPhone and iPad. Specifically, these browsers are required to employ the WebKit framework for rendering web pages. Consequently, third-party browsers cannot use their own rendering engines and must depend on Apple's framework instead. This constraint impacts the range of privacy features that these browsers can provide. This is one of the reasons why some browsers have partly addressed this shortcoming by offering additional privacy features that can be automatically enabled when using private browsing mode, such as Firefox's ""Tracking Protection"" feature to control use of web trackers (which has since been rolled into a larger ""content blocking"" function extended outside of private browsing mode), and Opera offering an in-house VPN service embedded within the browser.
Brazilian researchers published the results of a project where they applied forensic techniques (namely the Foremost data carving tool and Strings program) to extract information about the users browsing activities on Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers with their private mode enabled. They were able to collect enough data to identify pages visited and even partially reconstruct them. This research was later extended to include the Chrome and Safari browsers. The gathered data proved that the browsers' private mode implementations are not able to fully hide users' browsing activities and that browsers in private mode leave traces of activities in caching structures and files related to the paging process of the operating system.
Another independent security analysis, performed by a group of researchers at Newcastle University, reported a range of potential security vulnerabilities in the implementation of the private modes across Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari, including that;

Browser extensions could still record history if they were active in private mode. Although Chrome and Firefox have since required extensions to be enabled on an opt-in basis for their private browsing modes, an installed extension in the normal mode could learn the user's activities in the private mode by measuring the usage of shared computing resources.
Data erasure by the browser alone is found to be insufficient. For example, the records of visited websites during the private session can be retained in memory for a long time even after the private session is closed. In addition, the visited website records are usually kept by the operating system in the local DNS cache. Furthermore, the modified timestamps of certain profile files saved on the disk may reveal if the private mode was previously turned on and when it was turned on.
Software bugs present in some browsers were found to seriously degrade the security of the private mode. For example, in some earlier versions of Safari, the browser retained private browsing history records if the browser program was not closed normally (e.g., as a result of a crash), or if the user acted to add a bookmark within the private mode.
Depending on whether the session is in the private or the normal mode, web browsers typically exhibit different user interfaces and traffic characteristics. This allows a remote website to tell if the user is currently in the private mode, for example, by checking the color of the hyperlinks or measuring the time of writing cookies.
Bugs and security vulnerabilities in extensions themselves may also leak personally identifiable data from private mode.
Implementations of the HTML5 FileSystem API can be used to detect users in private mode. In Google Chrome, the FileSystem API was not available in Incognito mode prior to version 76. To prevent circumvention of paywall policies and evasion of web tracking scripts used to monetize traffic, a number of websites — including The New York Times  — have used such behavior to block access to users in private browsing mode, and requiring them to subscribe or log in. Chrome 76 allows the FileSystem API to be used in Incognito mode; explaining the change, Google argued that the ability to detect the use of Incognito mode infringes on users' privacy. However, it was later discovered that the disk space quotas for the API differed between normal and Incognito modes, providing another means by which to detect Incognito users. Despite statements otherwise by Google, this has not yet been patched. Scripts have also been developed to detect private browsing mode on other browsers, such as Firefox.


=== Associated lawsuit ===
In December 2023, Google settled a $5 billion consumer privacy lawsuit that alleged its practises allowed it to track users in private browsing mode in various browsers.

In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized CSC for spending US$4.39 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–10, instead getting US$305 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of US$1.67 billion.
In February 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a fraud investigation into CSC's accounting practices in Denmark and Australian business. CSC's CFO Mike Mancuso confirmed that accounting errors and intentional misconduct by certain personnel in Australia prompted SEC regulators to turn their gaze to Australia. Mancuso also stated that the alleged misconduct includes US$19 million in both intentional accounting irregularities and unintentional accounting errors. The SEC accused the former CEO Mike Laphen of fraud and clawed back $4,35 million
The company was accused of breaching human rights by arranging several illegal rendition flights for the CIA between 2003 and 2006, which also led to criticism of shareholders of the company, including the governments of Norway and Britain.
The company engaged in a number of activities that resulted in legal actions against it. These are:
Its so-called WorldBridge Service (Visa Services), which processed and issued millions of visa applications to enter Britain, did not involve British authorities.
In 1998, CSC was the prime contractor hired by the Internal Revenue Service to modernize its tax-filing system. They told the IRS it would meet a January 2006 deadline, but failed to do so, leaving the IRS with no system capable of detecting fraud. Its failure to meet the delivery deadline for developing an automated refund fraud detection system cost the IRS between US$200 million and US$300 million.

"Pindrop Security is an American information security company that provides risk scoring for phone calls to detect fraud and authenticate callers. The company analyzes several different features of a phone call that helps identify the uniqueness of a device and attaches it to a caller. In 2015, Pindrop screened more than 360 million calls.
Pindrop was a concept developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Vijay Balasubramaniyan, a computer science graduate from India studying the traits of wanted versus unwanted phone calls, teamed with his thesis advisor Mustaque Ahamad to launch a VentureLab project called Telineage in September 2010. Balasubramaniyan, Ahamad and two colleagues presented an ACM paper on what would become Pindrop's core technology.
Balasubramaniyan's idea was to acoustically fingerprint phone calls and associate that data with the phone number. In 2011, he and Paul Judge founded Pindrop as a voice security company that combats fraud by analyzing and assigning risk to phone calls.
The company obtained a license to the intellectual property from Georgia Tech Research Corporation, while VentureLab supported the company for a Phase I commercialization grant from the Georgia Research Alliance. In the same year, Pindrop placed second in Startup Riot, was named one of Top 40 Most Innovative Companies in Georgia by the Technology Association of Georgia (TAG), and won the TAG/GRA Business Launch Competition. Under the name Telineage, Pindrop also won National Science Foundation SBIR Phase I and Phase II Awards.
In 2012, Pindrop raised $1 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz, other venture capital firms and several angel investors. In June 2013, the company closed a $11 million Series A investment round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Citi Ventures, and also including Felicis Ventures and Redpoint, using the funds to scale up engineering, operations, sales and marketing in the US, Canada and Europe. In February 2015, Pindrop raised $35 million in a Series B round led by Institutional Venture Partners.
Their employee headcount totaled 70 at the beginning of 2015, which increased to 100 by June. In July, Pindrop released Fraud Detection System 2.4 (FDS), providing new tools for fraud analysts and call center technologists. Pindrop's 2015 revenue tripled, while its customer base doubled.
Pindrop Security raised another $75 million in 2016. Google Capital led the Series C round, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, GV and others, bringing the company's total funding to $122 million. It was a rare case of both Google Capital and Google Ventures (now GV) investing in the same startup.

In 2015, Federal Trade Commission singled out robocalling as the No. 1 consumer complaint in the U.S., with about 170,000 complaints a month. A Pindrop Security report The State of Phone Fraud 2014-2015: a Global, Cross-Industry Threat found that 86 million calls per month in the U.S. are phone scams. It also found that 1 in 6 phone numbers calling a consumer is a robocaller and 2.5 percent of U.S. phones receive at least one robocall per week. Such calls create the loss of more than $20 billion annually in the US alone.
The ""acoustic fingerprinting"" technology integrates with companies internal systems and identifies people's voices, locations, and devices. This is added to a database for future reference and to help separate legitimate callers from scammers.
The company listens for 147 different features that help identify the uniqueness of a device and attach it to a caller. To create metadata, Pindrop Security analyzed millions of phone calls in telecom databases from around the world and used machine learning to turn that information into usable content. By analyzing both the audio of a call and the metadata it has about a caller, the phoneprint reveals whether the caller is using a cell, landline, or VoIP phone; where the call really is coming from; and whether the caller has been seen before. It looks for evidence of frequency filters and codec artifacts, for example, and analyzes the calls for packet loss and dropped frames. In packet loss, ""pindrop""-sized bits of audio drop out, which is where the company's name came from.
Based on the analysis, the service generates a risk profile and a score for each call. Analyzing millions of samples from call centers, it can identify specific criminal groups. An example is a criminal group based in Nigeria nicknamed ""West Africa One."" According to Pindrop, the West Africa One has 12 members and Pindrop has assessed the skill levels of each of the 12 members.


=== Other tools ===
Pindrop has additional tools that update the company's fraudulent call database with relevant information. Phoneypot is a telephone honeypot with about a quarter-million phone numbers that are not being used by real people, which Pindrop uses for research. Workers enter the numbers into sweepstakes and online databases to collect data from millions of calls from robo-callers, debt collectors, and telemarketers. Among trends, the researchers found that older phone numbers attracted more calls than newer ones.
Topic Modeler is a proprietary online complaint collection tool that aggregates data on suspicious numbers from complaint sites, online communities, and web forums. Fraud Detection System (FDS) combines the company's Phoneprint technology and voice biometrics capabilities with an analytics-driven, unified workspace to more quickly detect and curb phone fraud. It allows fraud analysts to collect call samples, playback and annotate calls, query the system, and investigate possible patterns of fraud, all in one platform.
Ahamad and other researchers won an award on PhoneyPot at the Internet Society's 2015 Conference.

"Journal hijacking refers to the brandjacking of a legitimate academic journal by a malicious third party. Typically, the imposter journal sets up a fraudulent website for the purpose of offering scholars the opportunity to rapidly publish their research online for a fee. The term hijacked journal may refer to either  the fraud or the legitimate journal. The fraudulent journals are also known as ""clone journals"". Similar hijacking can occur with academic conferences.


== Background ==
In 2012,  cyber criminals began hijacking print-only journals by registering a domain name and creating a fake website under the title of the legitimate journals.
The first journal to be hijacked was the Swiss journal Archives des Sciences. In 2012 and 2013, more than 20 academic journals were hijacked. In some cases, scammers find their victims in conference proceedings, extracting authors' emails from papers and sending them fake calls for papers.
There have also been instances of journal hijacking wherein hijackers  take over the journal's existing domain name after the journal publisher neglects to pay the domain name registration fees on time.


== List of hijacked journals ==
There are several hundred documented cases of journal hijackings; hijacked journals with existing Wikipedia articles include:

"Cryptocurrency tracing is a digital forensic technique used to track and analyze the flow of cryptocurrencies across blockchain networks. Law enforcement agencies, regulators, and cybersecurity experts use cryptocurrency tracing to identify and combat fraud.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum use blockchain technology, allowing for ""trustless"" transactions verified without central intermediaries. Some blockchain networks are transparent and decentralized, providing transaction information specialists can use for tracing purposes. Transparency makes it possible to trace funds across different ledgers, even when criminals try to obscure their origins through techniques like mixing or converting between different cryptocurrencies.
Cryptocurrency tracing techniques include blockchain analysis, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and cross-ledger transaction tracking. These methods can identify patterns and links between transactions, allowing investigators to establish connections with real-world entities.
In the recent past, cryptocurrency tracing experts worked with law enforcement to bust large-scale frauds, such as advance-fee and phishing scams. Compliance officers can use tracing techniques to enforce anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and secure the integrity of cryptocurrency ecosystems.


== History ==
Cryptocurrency tracing appeared as a consequence of blockchain technology and digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cryptocurrency scams date back to the early days of Bitcoin. As blockchain technology evolved, so did fraud methods. It took a while to discover that many cryptocurrency transactions are traceable. Advanced tracing techniques can fight crypto crime and facilitate security and compliance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Blockchain technology has redefined online transactions. “Trustless” transactions do not require central intermediaries. Digital cash is semi-transparent, meaning that every transaction leaves a record, but nothing links transactions to identities. Perceived anonymity and borderless online transactions have enabled bad actors to target unsuspecting victims through scams like advance-fee fraud and phishing schemes. 
Cryptocurrency tracing is a possible answer to crypto scams. Tracing specialists use methods like blockchain analysis, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and cross-ledger transaction tracking to identify patterns and establish links between transactions. The objective is to link fraudulent activities to real-world identities and criminal networks.


== Techniques and Methods ==
Blockchain researchers have developed and adopted various techniques to track and analyze the flow of digital currencies across blockchain networks, where possible. 


=== Blockchain Analysis ===
Blockchain analysis peers into the immutable transaction records in blockchain ledgers. By examining transaction histories and identifying patterns, analysts try to link seemingly unrelated transactions and reveal the flow of funds through different addresses and wallets.


=== DBSCAN ===
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) identifies groups of related transactions or addresses by analyzing the density of transaction data points. DBSCAN is an algorithm used in machine learning that can reveal networks of addresses controlled by the same entity, despite obfuscation attempts. By clustering these addresses, investigators can gain a clearer picture of the structure and scale of illicit operations.


=== Cross-ledger Transaction Tracking ===
Cross-ledger transaction tracking is a technique used to trace the movement of funds across different cryptocurrency networks. Platforms like ShapeShift allow users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another. Investigators can follow funds moving between different blockchains through such platforms, even when criminals try to obscure their origins through currency conversion.


=== Graph Analysis ===
Some cryptocurrency tracing specialists use graphs to represent wallets and transactions. The visual representation of blockchain transactions allows investigators to identify patterns, spot address clusters, and gain other insights. 
By combining these techniques, law enforcement, regulators, and cybersecurity experts can detect and combat illicit activities, making cryptocurrency ecosystems safer.

"Netcraft is an Internet services company based in London, England. The company provides cybercrime disruption services across a range of industries. 


== History ==
Netcraft was founded by Mike Prettejohn in Bath, Somerset. The company provides web server and web hosting market-share analysis, including web server and operating system detection. In some cases, depending on the queried server's operating system, their service is able to monitor uptimes; uptime performance monitoring is a commonly used factor in determining the reliability of a web hosting provider.
The company is also known for its free anti-phishing toolbar for the Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome browsers. Starting with version 9.5, the built-in anti-phishing filter in the Opera browser uses the same data as Netcraft's toolbar, eliminating the need for a separately installed toolbar. A study commissioned by Microsoft concluded that Netcraft's toolbar was among the most effective tools to combat phishing on the Internet, although this has since been superseded by Microsoft's own Internet Explorer 7 with Microsoft Phishing Filter, possibly as a result of licensing Netcraft's data. The service can only process public IPv4 servers at the exclusion of IPv6. The browser extensions will display security information for a domain's IPv4 servers even when the user is connected to a different server over IPv6.
In November 2016, Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced plans for the UK government to work with Netcraft to develop better automatic defences to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks affecting the UK. As of 2022, Netcraft operated the UK government’s National Cyber Security Centre malicious website takedown service.
In 2023, Netcraft secured growth investment of $100 million from Spectrum Equity Management and appointed a new chief executive, Ryan Woodley. It also moved its headquarters from Bath to London. In September 2023, Netcraft announced the acquisition of Australian internet security analysts FraudWatch International, who have 70 staff.
In 2024, Netcraft released its innovative approach to combating online fraud. By leveraging its AI platform, Netcraft creates decoys to lure scammers, allowing it to monitor and analyze their tactics in real-time. This method enhances their ability to detect and counteract fraudulent activities, improving online security and safeguarding users.

"Kenneth J. Block (born October 11, 1965) is an American businessman, software engineer, and political reformer. He is the founder of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, the state's third-largest political party, and ran as the Moderate candidate for Governor of Rhode Island in the 2010 election.
While leader of the Moderate Party, Block was an advocate for economic, educational, and political reforms in Rhode Island. His court battle to gain official state recognition for the Moderates in 2009 overturned several unconstitutional laws and made it easier for third parties to gain signatures and access election ballots. In a highly contested four-way election, Block received 6.5% of the vote in the Governor's Race.
Block emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of the Rhode Island General Assembly in the aftermath of the 2010 elections. He publicly opposed the controversial $75 million loan and subsequent taxpayer bailout of 38 Studios, the taxpayer-funded redevelopment the Superman Building, and introduction of the Sakonnet River Bridge toll. Block has also called for the elimination of the ""master lever"" from election ballots which he argues creates voter disenfranchisement and unfairly benefits larger political parties. He eventually created MasterLever.org to explain his position and enable the public to contact state officials via e-mail.
As a small business owner, Block has run several software companies which have worked with state governments to identify fraud and government waste in social service and welfare programs. In 1995, Block was able to save the state of Texas over $1 billion by developing a new statewide debit card system. Shortly after the 2010 election, Block offered his company's help free of charge to find waste and fraud in Rhode Island's entitlement programs. He was subsequently involved in the state's Medicare waste and fraud report as well as assisting the Providence Police Department's fraud unit to better access state records in late 2012. Police investigators have claimed that the new computer software will help detect millions of dollars in fraud.
He also served as president of RI Taxpayers, a taxpayer advocacy and watchdog group, until his resignation in May 2013 when he announced his candidacy for governor in the 2014 election. In October 2013, Block announced that he had joined the Rhode Island Republican Party and intended to challenge Cranston Mayor Allan Fung in the upcoming Republican primary. He based his campaign on a plan to save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion by eliminating wasteful spending.


== Early life ==
Kenneth J. Block was born and raised in Milford, Connecticut. The oldest of three children, Block's family lived in the same house as his grandparents. He graduated from Milford High School in 1983 and then attended Dartmouth College where he earned a bachelor's degree in computer science four years later. Block began his career writing software for Wall Street trading desks during the late 1980s. He was employed by the Bank of New England and worked at small software consultancy firms Dalcomp Corporation and LOBB Systems. In 1991, Block moved to Rhode Island to work for the Providence-based GTECH Corporation. Although initially a one-year consultancy, he stayed with the company for another six years. From 1995 to 1999, Block was president of Kinetic Consulting, Inc., a software consultation firm that worked with state agencies to identify government waste and abuse as well as improving the overall efficiency of their spending programs, until the dot-com bust forced him to close the company.
In 2001, Block founded Simpatico Software Systems, a data mining service used by government agencies and private businesses to track waste and fraud. Additionally, it supplies software services to the SNAP program. Similar to his first company, Simpatico Systems also provided engineering and consulting services. Its clients have included the EVERTEC and GTECH Corporations, Northrop Grumman, and the state government of Texas. In Texas, Block's company developed a statewide debit card system for food stamp and welfare recipients that saved the state more than $1 billion. Two years later he created a second company, Cross Alert Systems, which manufactures ""intelligent"" traffic systems for recreational trail and public road intersections.


== Political career ==

In 2007, Block decided to enter the Rhode Island political scene. In later interviews, Block said that he entered politics out of frustration with the state government's inability to solve Rhode Island's declining economy and education system. He was particularly concerned that his children were not getting a quality education in public schools and, like many young Rhode Islanders, would eventually have to leave the state due to high unemployment. He also noted the difficulty for small business owners to operate in the state and that the high tax rate forced many companies to relocate to Massachusetts and elsewhere. As a longtime business owner himself, Block believed many of these problems could easily be fixed though basic fiscal responsibility and ""common sense"" leadership.
Disillusioned with both the Democratic and Republican parties, who he felt were more concerned battling over social issues, Block believed that starting a centrist-based third-party would be the best option. His political affiliation is unknown before 2007, however, Block has stated his admiration for former RI Governor Bruce Sundlun. A Brown University political poll reported that 74% of Rhode Islanders were dissatisfied with the state's political leadership and ""would be supportive of a new moderate political party"". A poll run by Block produced similar numbers. He reasoned that if his party could attract enough moderate voters, they would be able to put pressure on then Republican Governor Donald L. Carcieri and the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to address vital issues he felt were being neglected by the state.
The Moderate Party of Rhode Island was founded by Block a year later. An official website was launched in early-2008 and several candidates were endorsed in the general election - Jean Ann Guliano (D), John Pagliarini (R), Matt McHugh (I), and Christopher Little (I). On October 23, 2008, Block co-hosted Operation Clean Government's State of the State with former RI attorney general Arlene Violet interviewing all four candidates. Gaining official recognition by the state was ""a fight and a half"" according to Block. In February 2009, Block and American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the state to gain official party status. U.S. District Judge William Smith, striking down several ballot access laws as unconstitutional, ruled in the Moderate Party's favor three months later. The Moderate Party were able to collect over 34,000 signatures, the 12th highest number of signatures in the country, to qualify as a political party and were placed on the 2010 ballot. Afterwards, Block said that Rhode Island was the most difficult state to start a political party. The Moderate Party would find support from a number of prominent figures including former Hasbro CEO Alan G. Hassenfeld, Arlene Violet, and former U.S. Attorney Robert Clark Corrente, the latter briefly serving as party chairman.


== 2010 election ==

Block was the Moderate Party's candidate for Governor during the 2010 election. He had not intended to run for office, however, Block reluctantly stepped in failing to find a suitable candidate in time. Block had developed an interest in civics and government while at Dartmouth College in the 1980s though he had no political experience prior to the campaign. He was successful in gaining the necessary signatures 1,000 registered voters to get on the ballot. His door-to-door campaigning in South Kingstown was included in a feature story for Rhode Island Monthly. Block was one of the candidates profiled on Fox Providence's The Rhode Show for its ""Coffee with the Candidates"" segment.
Block finished fourth in the statewide general election with 22,146 votes garnering 6.5% of the vote. He followed Democrat Frank Caprio with 78,896 votes (23%), Republican John Robitaille with 114,911 votes (33.6%), and the winner Independent Lincoln Chafee with 123,571 votes (36.1%). Though an impressive performance for a first-time candidate Block was blamed for his part in the four-way race that allowed Chafee to win the election. The Republican Party of Rhode Island was particularly critical of Block for splitting the race as their candidate, John Robitaille, lost to Chafee by less than 4% of the vote.


== Post-election ==
Block continued his political activism as leader of the Moderate Party, stressing the need for economic, educational, and governmental reforms. He made several guest appearances on Rhode Island PBS's public affairs television program A Lively Experiment and Operation Clean Government's State of the State. He began a movement to abolish the ""master lever"", and worked with the state to uncover fraud and waste in the state's welfare programs, going so far as to offer his company's services to Governor Chafee at no charge. In January 2013, Block began teaching a technology and business class as an adjunct professor at the University of Rhode Island.
An outspoken critic of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he challenged a number of controversial decisions made by the legislative body. While running for Governor, Block criticized the state's $75 million loan to 38 Studios, in exchange for the video game company moving its headquarters from Maynard, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island, suggesting that the money would be better spent investing in local businesses. He was also strongly opposed to taxpayer-funded redevelopment of the Superman Building and the introduction of the Sakonnet River Bridge toll. Block called this most recent legislation by the assembly an ""awful decision"" and condemned the Rhode Island Democratic Party as ""[proving] itself completely incapable of governing the state.""
In November 2020, Block was hired by the Trump Campaign to hire him to find evidence of election fraud. Block wrote a book about the experience in a book, Disproven which was published March 12, 2024.


=== Combating fraud and government waste ===
Shortly after the 2010 election, Democratic State Representative Lisa Baldelli Hunt urged Governor Lincoln Chafee to contact Block about working with state agencies to uncover fraud in Rhode Island's Medicaid programs. In April 2011, Block volunteered his company's services free of charge to help the state identify waste and fraud in Health and Human Services spending. He was not able to testify in person before the House and Senate Finance Committee that month; a written statement was submitted into the record instead.   Two months later, Block talked with both the Department of Human Services and the Department of Labor and Training about using his company's services free of charge. After several months negotiating with the Chafee administration, Block announced on WPRO's The John DePetro Show that his company was close to reaching an agreement to start working with state agencies to investigate waste and abuse in Rhode Island's welfare system.
Block's company, Simpatico Software Systems, began working with the Providence Police Department's fraud unit in late 2012. Simpatico Systems developed a computer program so that fraud investigators can more easily access state records. The unit's two investigators, Jack Costa and Daniel Murphy, had previously been dependent on more than a dozen other agencies throughout the state and records were often unavailable in the current system. The Simpatico system specifically assisted the Providence Housing Authority in sharing data with the state government. Their efforts were featured on the November 6th edition of WPRI's Eyewitness News. It was claimed that the new computer software would help investigators detect millions of dollars in fraud. He was later involved in the Rhode Island Health and Human Services Waste and Fraud Report which submitted its preliminary findings in early 2013.


=== Ban the Master Lever initiative ===
Another reform pushed by Block was the elimination of straight-ticket or ""master lever"" voting, which allows voters to cast a ballot for all candidates of a single political party with one vote, arguing that it confuses and disenfranchises voters. The master lever was first introduced to Rhode Island in 1939 when voting machines required voters to physically pull multiple levers to cast a vote. These machines were eventually replaced with a modern electronic system in the late 1990s, yet the law remained in place. Block was among those who testified before the Rhode Island Senate in a judiciary hearing on the elimination of the master lever in March 2012.
A later study conducted by the Moderate Party, which examined ballots from the 2010 election in Burrillville, Rhode Island, indicated that voters did not understand how to use the master lever. Voters that chose to vote for all Democratic candidates would often cancel out their votes when continuing to cast individual votes further down in the ballot. Block cited the Moderate Party's campaign in the November 2012 election as an example with, he said, over 9,000 Rhode Island voters using the Moderate Party master lever mechanism despite not having a Moderate candidate on the ballot. Politifact judged this claim as 'mostly true"" saying that there were slightly under 9,000 such votes.
Another issue caused by the master lever, critics argue, is ""under voting"" at the local level, where many offices are officially non-partisan, with candidates being skipped on the ballot because they do not belong to a political party. The master lever also created an unfair advantage for majority political parties at the expense of minority and third parties. Both Allan Fung and Scott Avedisian, Republican mayors of Cranston and Warwick respectively, agreed with this view; a ballot recount by Fung in his 2006 election revealed serious irregularities in votes cast by the master lever. In U.S. presidential elections, many voters unknowingly elect candidates simply by voting for a presidential nominee. An estimated 46,000 voters used the master lever during the 2010 gubernatorial elections, a number which doubled during the 2012 U.S. presidential election, giving local Democrats a huge advantage over non-Democratic candidates.
In January 2013, Block launched MasterLever.org to inform the public about the problems using the obsolete voting system in local and state elections. The website allowed supporters to send an automated letter to state officials including House Speaker Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, and Governor Lincoln Chafee. Within a week of its launch, 500 people had sent letters via the website in support the banning the master lever. That number rose to 2,600 within four months. Although the majority of the General Assembly remained silent on the issue, Block's initiative eventually gained support from key political figures including Democratic Secretary of State Ralph Mollis and Governor Chafee. Block polled legislators at the State House for their stance on the master lever which he then made available on the website. A ban on the master lever was also supported by RI-based government watchdog groups Common Cause, Operation Clean Government, and the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition.
Block made a second appearance on the April 5th edition of A Lively Experiment where he talked about his views on the master lever, payday loans, and state tax credits. Block's report on waste and fraud in Rhode Island's state social service programs was also a topic of discussion on the show.


=== Involvement with RI Taxpayers ===
On February 4, 2013, Block succeeded Harriet Lloyd as president of the taxpayer advocacy group RI Taxpayers (formerly known as the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition). The decision was discussed a week later on A Lively Experiment; one of the guest panelists, columnist Donna Perry, was the executive director of RI Taxpayers.
As president of the organization, Block was an active public speaker and made numerous appearances before state committee hearings. On March 13, 2013, he testified before RI House Judiciary Committee on behalf of both the Moderate Party and RI Taxpayers urging the members to pass legislation for eliminating ""master lever"" voting in the state. At the RI Taxpayers' annual meeting on May 11, Block issued a formal challenge to the General Assembly to ""stop stalling"" on economic-related legislation for businesses and taxpayers before adjourning next month. At another meeting, Block called for more citizen involvement in local government and warned that voter apathy, especially among people under 40, would continue to result in poor legislation and a lack of accountability by political leadership. He also spoke about the importance of economic reforms and the need to improve the state's business climate. After a four-month term, Block resigned his position with RI Taxpayers to run in the 2014 elections.


== 2014 election ==

On May 21, 2013, Block announced he would once again run for office as Governor of Rhode Island in the 2014 election. Weeks later, political operative Jeff Britt joined the Moderate Party as Block's campaign manager. Britt was previously a political ally of Democratic House Speaker Gordon Fox and former Republican governor Don Carcieri. His campaign was endorsed by blogger and third-party activist Dennis Mikolay praising him as a government watchdog. One of his last public appearances as a Moderate candidate took place at Roger Williams University on September 30, 2013.


== Switch to the Republican Party ==
On October 28, 2013, Block officially announced at a Barrington town hall meeting that he would be joining the Republican Party with the intention of running as its candidate for the 2014 gubernatorial election. The news was not totally unexpected as Block, who had been largely funding the Moderate Party with his own finances, including his 2010 campaign, held a poll on his chances running as a Moderate or Republican candidate over the summer. A Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions poll indicated only 9% of participants would vote for Block as a Moderate candidate. Three months earlier, Block suggested that he would be open to running as a Republican during a WPRO interview with Buddy Cianci. He had also been courted by Republican  Joe Trillo to join the party partially to prevent another four-way race which allowed then independent candidate Lincoln Chafee to win the 2010 election.
John DePetro called Block's decision a ""smart political move"" and speculated on the upcoming GOP primary between Block and Republican party favorite Cranston mayor Allan Fung. The news was also discussed on A Lively Experiment with guest panelists Dave Layman, WPRO/WPRI legal analyst Louis Pulner, Brown University political science professor Wendy Schiller, and Arlene Violet.
Block declared his intention to run as the party's nominee in a letter to 20,000 Republican voters and based his campaign on an ambitious plan to save the state $1 billion in government waste over a four-year period. He further explained that this amount could easily be achieved by focusing on ""off budget"" spending such as public sector retiree healthcare, temporary disability, and unemployment insurance. Block offered the state's Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) program as an example. Cutting the annual costs in half for the TDI program, which is twice as much to run as New Jersey, would save $80 million alone. Block outlined his plan on his official website in addition to other forums as well. In November 2013, he was invited to write a column for The Providence Journal to make his case for saving the state $1 billion by eliminating government waste. Block was also interviewed by Tim White and Ted Nesi on the November 15th edition of WPRI's Eyewitness News and further explained his plan to save the state $1 billion.
That same month, PolitiFact.com rated a claim by Block that Rhode Island has the most expensive unemployment system in the country as ""false"". According to the ""2014 State Business Tax Climate Index"", published by the Tax Foundation, Rhode Island ranked 46 out of the 50 states. In the report, Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system was rated the worst in the country, however, that alone did not indicate it was the most expensive. Block's policy director, Matthew Schweich, defended the statement pointing out that Rhode Island was ranked near the bottom in almost every category and argued that the cumulative effect supports their claim. Block responded to the website in a letter to the editor of The Providence Journal acknowledging the error ""but choosing the wrong words and intentionally misleading voters are different types of mistakes"".
In December 2013, longtime Rhode Island GOP fundraiser Tony Bucci resigned his slot on Fung's campaign committee to join Ken Block's gubernatorial campaign as a senior adviser and finance chairman.
Block lost the primary to Fung, 55% to 45%.

"Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. is an American biotech company founded in 2008 by five scientists from MIT, headed by Jason Kelly. The company specializes in using genetic engineering to produce bacteria with industrial applications for other biotech companies, saving other companies the cost of reproducing the initial stages of design in synthetic biology. The self-proclaimed ""Organism Company""  was one of the world's largest privately held biotech companies, valued at $4.2 billion in 2019. It raised $290 million in September and $350 million in October of that year. Ginkgo Bioworks went public on the New York Stock Exchange via a SPAC merger on September 17, 2021.


== History ==
In 2014, Ginkgo was the first biotechnology company to join the Y Combinator start-up accelerator program.
On 16 December 2020, it was reported that Ginkgo Bioworks would acquire the primary assets of Novogy's Microbial Engineering Platform.  2020 also saw the company acquire property worth $25 million from Marcus Partners for the construction of a new 219,000 square foot laboratory building, after razing existing structures, located in the Raymond L Flynn Marine Park.  As of 2021, the company also occupied 200,000 square feet of the Innovation and Design Building (aka IDB) in the Park.  Ginkgo also occupied facilities in Cambridge, where most MIT-spin outs resided at the time.
Growth of Ginkgo up to 2021 had been driven by ""robust venture capital funding"" and entry into the COVID-19 testing market.  This included $45 million from Viking Global in 2015.
On 11 May 2021, Ginkgo Bioworks announced plans of going public through a merger with SPAC Soaring Eagle at a $17.5 billion valuation. 
On 14 May 2021, Ginkgo announced its new ticker for the NYSE will be ""DNA"". The ticker was previously used by Genentech, who stopped using the ticker after they were acquired by Roche. Trading began on September 17, 2021. The investment management firm Baillie Gifford became the largest shareholder (15%) with the purchase of 167.75 million shares on 31 March 2022.
On 14 March 2022, it was reported that Ginkgo Bioworks signed a Definitive Agreement to Acquire FGen AG, a leading bioengineering company and its proprietary ultra-high-throughput screening platform.
On 6 June 2022, it was reported that Ginkgo Bioworks has acquired assets from real-time metabolite monitoring company, Bitome.
On 25 July 2022, Ginkgo Bioworks agreed to acquire Zymergen for $300 million in an all-stock deal.
On 27 July 2022, it was reported that Ginkgo Bioworks would acquire Bayer's Biologics Research & Development site, located in West Sacramento. Ginkgo will enter into a new multi-year platform collaboration with Bayer. The deal includes the integration of the R&D platform assets from Joyn Bio, a joint-venture between Leaps by Bayer investments and Ginkgo Bioworks.
On 4 October 2022, it was reported that Ginkgo Bioworks would acquire France-based adaptive laboratory evolution instruments developer Altar and California-based Circularis to strengthen capabilities in cell and gene therapy.
In October 2022, Bloomberg News reported that Ginkgo Bioworks partnered with Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity to create a software tool to help detect when biological organisms have been genetically engineered. The tool known as ENDAR (short for Engineered Nucleotide Detection and Ranking) could be used to provide an early warning of bioweapons and other man-made biological threats.


== Fraud allegations ==
On 6 October 2021, a market research firm published a report accusing Ginkgo of embellishing its revenue in a complex scheme highly dependent on related-party transactions. The report prompted an inquiry into Ginkgo by the United States Department of Justice. In November 2021, Ginkgo was sued in a shareholder lawsuit alleging it misrepresented its revenue sources in statements regarding its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. As of 2021, the company could not name a single significant product that is manufactured and sold using its organisms.
In March 2023, the former Attorney General of Louisiana launched an investigation into the officers and directors of Ginkgo.

"Trusteer is a Boston-based computer security division of IBM, responsible for a suite of security software.  Founded by Mickey Boodaei and Rakesh K. Loonkar, in Israel in 2006, Trusteer was acquired in September 2013 by IBM for $1 billion.
Trusteer's products aim to block online threats from malware and phishing attacks and to support regulatory compliance requirements. Trusteer's malware research team aims to analyze information received from the installed base of 30,000,000 user endpoints and hundreds of organizations.
Trusteer has a presence in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Japan and China.


== Products ==
Trusteer's products aim to prevent incidents at the point of attack while investigating their source to mitigate future attacks. In addition, Trusteer allows organizations to receive immediate alerts and to report whenever a new threat is launched against them or their customers.


=== Trusteer Rapport ===
Trusteer Rapport is security software advertised as an additional layer of security to anti-virus software. It is designed to protect confidential data, such as account credentials, from being stolen by malicious software (malware) and via phishing. To achieve this goal, the software includes anti-phishing measures to protect against misdirection and attempts to prevent malicious screen scraping; it attempts to protect users against the following forms of attacks: man-in-the-browser, man-in-the-middle, session hijacking and screen capturing.
On installation, Rapport also tries to remove existing financial malware from end-user machines and to prevent future infections.
The client is available for multiple platforms in the form of a browser extension. As of March 2020, the Windows version supports Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows 7 and later; while the macOS version supports Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari on macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and later.
Financial institutions offer the software free of charge with a view to making online banking safer for customers.  Banks which offer the software, or have offered it in the past, include Bank of America, Société Générale, Tangerine, INGDirect, HSBC, CIBC, BMO, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank), Ecobank Davivienda and First Republic Bank.
Some banks which had offered the software discontinued offering it. For instance, NatWest and RBS withdrew use in January 2019, stating that ""The security and fraud prevention technologies we now use provide you a higher and far broader level of protection.""


=== Trusteer Pinpoint ===
Trusteer Pinpoint is a web-based service that allows financial institutions to detect and mitigate malware, phishing and account takeover attacks without installing any software on endpoint devices. It allows companies concerned about online fraud or data theft to scan their Web traffic to ensure that an outside laptop or desktop that is brought into a corporate network is not infected with malware before allowing the visitor access to their Web services.
Trusteer Pinpoint combines device fingerprinting, proxy detection and malware infection detection. When a user infected with malware accesses an online banking site protected by Trusteer Pinpoint Malware Detection, it identifies the infection and malware type (e.g. “User Steve is infected with Prinimalka-Gozi”), alerts the bank and flags the user's credentials as compromised. Once notified, banks can immediately contact the end user to have them install Trusteer Rapport which will remove the malware. Trusteer Pinpoint Account Takeover Detection also fingerprints the device and checks for the use of proxies.


=== Trusteer Mobile Fraud Risk Prevention ===
Mobile Risk Engine aims to protect organizations against mobile and PC-to-mobile (cross-channel) attacks. The product tries to detect and stops account takeover from mobile devices by identifying criminal access attempts. It also tries to identify devices that are vulnerable to compromise by malware and those that have been infected. Trusteer Mobile Risk Engine is a web-based service that includes the Trusteer Mobile SDK, Trusteer Mobile App, Trusteer Mobile Out-of-Band Authentication, and Mobile Risk API. The combination of Mobile Risk Engine and its client-side components provides device fingerprinting for mobile devices, account takeover prevention from mobile devices, detection of compromised mobile devices, and access to a global fraudster database.


=== Trusteer Apex ===
Trusteer Apex is an automated solution that tries to prevent exploits and malware from compromising the endpoints and extracting information. Apex has three layers of security: exploit prevention, data exfiltration prevention and credentials protection.  Apex protects employee credentials from phishing attacks by validating that employees are submitting their credentials only to authorized enterprise web-application login URLs. Apex also prevents corporate employees from re-using their corporate credentials to access non-corporate, public applications like PayPal, eBay, Facebook or Twitter. Apex requires users to provide different credentials for such applications, to lower the risk of credentials exposure.
Trusteer Apex is targeted at the behaviors of a small group of applications, on the hypothesis that they are responsible for the overwhelming majority of exploits, namely Java, Adobe's Reader and Flash, and Microsoft Office. The technology behind Trusteer Apex does not rely on threat signatures, or on so-called ""whitelists"" of good applications. Instead, it watches applications as they run and spots suspicious or malicious behavior, based on knowledge of ""normal"" application behavior that it has refined from its large user base. Trusteer claims Apex can block both web-based attacks that are used to implant malware by exploiting vulnerable applications, and data loss due to malware infections by spotting attempts by untrusted applications or processes to send data outside an organization or connect with Internet-based command and control (C&C) networks.


== Technical concerns ==
End users have reported problems with Rapport, slow PCs due to high CPU and RAM utilization, incompatibility with various security/antivirus products and difficulty in removing the software.
The consumer organisation Which? found that many members had problems due to running Trusteer Rapport, and advised against using it. They found that it could conflict with other security software, and slow or crash the Web browser. Which? emphasises that it is the bank's responsibility, not Rapport's, to protect customers' online banking, adding that online banking can be perfectly safe without Trusteer Rapport; its only benefit would be detecting a phishing site masquerading as the bank—""but plenty of other tools, including most modern browsers, can do this anyway"". They clarify that the software is legitimate and respectable, but ""don't feel the claims on Rapport's website add up"".
In a presentation given at 44con in September 2011, bypassing Trusteer Rapport's keylogger protection was shown to be relatively trivial. Shortly thereafter Trusteer confirmed that the flaw was corrected and said that even if a hacker were able to use the flaw to disable anti-keylogging functions in Rapport, other secondary security protection technologies would still be in play.
Rapport software is incompatible with Windows tool Driver Verifier and may cause Blue Screen and system crash.


== Blue Gem lawsuit ==
In March 2011, Blue Gem, a rival company, filed a lawsuit against Trusteer in a California court.Trusteer has described the accusations as ""baseless"".

"Click tracking is when user click behavior or user navigational behavior is collected in order to derive insights and fingerprint users. Click behavior is commonly tracked using server logs which encompass click paths and clicked URLs (Uniform Resource Locator). This log is often presented in a standard format including information like the hostname, date, and username. However, as technology develops, new software allows for in depth analysis of user click behavior using hypervideo tools. Given that the internet can be considered a risky environment, research strives to understand why users click certain links and not others. Research has also been conducted to explore the user experience of privacy with making user personal identification information individually anonymized and improving how data collection consent forms are written and structured.
Click tracking is relevant in several industries including Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), software engineering, and advertising. Email tracking, link tracking, web analytics, and user research are also related concepts and applications of click tracking. A common utilization of click data from click tracking is to improve results' positions from search engines to make their order more relevant to users' needs. Click tracking employs many modern techniques such as machine learning and data mining.


== Tracking and recording technology ==

Tracking and recording technologies (TRTs) can be split into two categories, institutional TRTs and end-user TRTs. Institutional TRTs and end-user TRTs differ by who is collecting and storing the data, and this can be respectively understood as institutions and users. Examples of TRTs include radio frequency identification (RFID), credit cards, and store video cameras. Research suggests that individuals are concerned with privacy, but they are less concerned with how TRTs are used daily. This discrepancy has been attributed to the public not understanding how information about them is getting collected.
Another means of obtaining user input is eye-tracking or gaze tracking. Gaze-tracking technology is especially beneficial for those with motor disabilities. Systems that employ gaze-tracking often try to mimic cursor and keyboard behavior. In this process, the gaze-tracking system is separated into its own panel in the system interface, and the user experience of this system is compromised as individuals have to switch between the panel and the other interface features. The experience is also difficult because users have to first imagine how to complete the task using keyboard and cursor features and then employ gaze. This causes tasks to take additional time. Hence, researchers created their own web browser called GazeTheWeb (GTW), and the focus of their research was on the user experience. They improved the interface to incorporate gaze better.
Eye-movement tracking is also applied in usability testing when creating web applications. However, in order to track user eye movements, a lab setting with appropriate equipment is often required. Mouse and keyboard activity can be measured remotely, so this quality can be capitalized for usability testing. Algorithms can use mouse movements to predict and trace user eye movements. Such tracking in a remote environment is denoted as a remote logging technique.

Browser fingerprinting is another means of identifying users and tracking them. In this process, information about a user is collected from their web browser to create a browser fingerprint. A browser fingerprint contains information about a device, its operating system, its browser, and its configuration. HTTP headers, JavaScript, and browser plugins can be used to build a fingerprint. Browser fingerprints can change over time from automatic software updates or user browser preference adjustments. Measures to increase privacy in this realm can reduce functionality by blocking features.


== Methods of click tracking ==
User browsing behavior is often tracked using server access logs which contain patterns of clicked URLs, queries, and paths. However, more modern tracking software utilizes JavaScript in order to track cursor behavior. The collected mouse data can be used to create videos, allowing for user behavior to be replayed and easily analyzed. Hypermedia is used to create such visualizations that allow for behavior like highlighting, hesitating, and selecting to be monitored. Technology that is used to record such behavior can also be used to predict it. One of these monitoring tools, SMT2є, collects fifteen cursor features and uses the other fourteen to predict the last feature's outcome. This software also generates a log analysis which summarizes user cursor activity.
In a search session, users can be identified using cookies, identd protocol, or their IP address. This information can then be stored in a database, and every time a user visits a web page again, their click behavior will be appended to the database. DoubleClick Inc. is an example of a company that has such a database and partners with other companies to aid with their web mining. Cookies are added to HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and when a user clicks on a link, they are connected to the associated web server. This action of a user clicking on a link is seen as a request, and the server “responds” by sending the user's information, and this information is a cookie. Cookies provide a “bookmark” for users’ sessions on a website, and they store user login information and the pages users visit on a website. This aids with preserving the state of the session. If there is more than one such server, information must be consistent among all servers; hence, information is transferred. Data collected via cookies can be used to improve websites for all users and this also aids with user profiling for advertising.
When data mining techniques and statistical procedures are applied to understand web log data, the process is noted as log analysis or web usage mining. This helps with determining patterns in the users’ navigational behaviors. Some features that can be observed include how long users viewed pages for, click path lengths, and the number of clicks. Web usage mining has three phases. First, the log data is ""preprocessed"" to see the users and search sessions’ content. Then, tools like association and clustering are applied to look for patterns, and lastly, these patterns are saved to be further analyzed. The tool of association rule mining helps with finding “patterns, associations, and correlations” among pages users visit in a search session. Sequential pattern discovery is association rule mining, but it also accounts for time like the page views in an allotted time period. Classification is a tool that allows for pages to be added to groups representing certain similar qualities.
Some examples of tools individuals can use when conducting click analytics are the Google Analytics tool In-Page Analytics, ClickHeat, and Crazy Egg. These tools create a visual from user click data on a webpage. ClickHeat and Crazy Egg showcase the density of user clicks using specific colors, and all of these tools allow for webpage visitors to be categorized into groups by qualities like being a mobile user or using a particular browser. The specific groups' data can be analyzed for further insight.


== Click behaviour ==
One of the main factors users consider when clicking links is a link's position in a list of results. The closer links are to the top, the more likely they are to be selected by users. When users have a personal connection to a subject matter they tend to click that article more frequently. Pictures, position, and specific individuals in the news content also more heavily influenced users’ decisions. The source of the news was deemed as less important.
Click attitude and click intention play a large role in user click behavior. In one study when research participants were presented with positive and negative insurance advertisement photographs, emotion was seen to have a positive association with click intention and click attitude. The researchers also observed that click attitude affects click intention, and positive emotion has more of an impact than negative emotion on click attitude.
The internet can be considered a risky environment due to the abundance of cybersecurity attacks that can occur and the prevalence of malware. Hence, whenever individuals use the internet, they have to decide whether or not to click on the various links. A 2018 study found that users tend to click on more URLs on websites they are familiar with; this user trait is then exploited by cybercriminals, and personal information can be compromised. Hence, trust is seen to also increase click-through intention. When given Google Chrome warnings, 70% of the time people will click through. They also tend to adjust default computer settings in this process. Users were also found to better recognize malware risks when there is a greater potential for revealing their personal information.


== Relevance of search results ==
Pages that are viewed by users during a particular search session constitute click data. Such data can be used to improve search results in two ways, as explicit and implicit feedback. Explicit feedback is when users indicate which pages are relevant to their search query, while implicit feedback is when user behavior is interpreted to determine results’ relevance. Certain user actions on a webpage that can be used as a part of the interpretation process include bookmarking, saving, or printing a particular web page. Through collecting click data from a few individuals, the relevance of results for all users for given queries can improve. In a search session, a user indicates which documents they are more interested in with their clicks, and this indicates what is relevant to the search. The most relevant click data to determine relevance of results is often the last viewed web page rather than all of the pages clicked on in a search session. Click data outside of search sessions can also be used to improve the accuracy of relevant results for users.
The search results to a given query are usually subject to positional bias. This is because users tend to select links that are at the top of result lists. However, this position does not mean a result is the most relevant since relevance can change over time. As a part of a machine learning approach to improving the result order, human editors begin by supplying an original rank for each result to the algorithm. Then, live user click feedback in the form of tracked click-through rates (CTR) in search sessions can be used to rerank the results based on the data. This improves the order of the results based on the live indicated relevance from the users.
Click dwell time and click sequence information can also be used to improve the relevance of search results. Click dwell time is how long a user takes to return to the search engine results page (SERP) after clicking on a particular result, and this can indicate how satisfied the user is with a particular result. Eye-tracking research indicates that users exhibit an abundance of non-sequential viewing activity when looking at search results. Click models that abide by “top-down” user click behavior cannot interpret the user process of revisiting pages.


== Extensions ==


=== Advertising ===
Supply-demand mismatch costs can be reduced through click tracking. Huang et al. defines strategic customers as “forward looking” individuals who know that their clicks are being tracked and expect that companies will engage in appropriate business activities. In the conducted study, researchers used clickstream data from customers to observe their preferences and desired product quantities. Noisy clicks are when customers click but do not actually buy the product. This leads to imperfect advanced demand information or ADI.
Click tracking can be used in the realm of advertising, but there is the potential for this tool to be used negatively. Publishers display advertisements on their websites, and they receive money depending on the amount of traffic, measured as a number of clicks, they send to the advertisers website. Click fraud is when publishers fake clicks to generate revenue for themselves. In the 2012 Fraud Detection in Mobile Advertising (FDMA) conference, competition teams were tasked with having to use data mining and machine learning techniques to determine “fraudulent publishers” from a given dataset. A successful algorithm is able to observe and use morning and night click traffic patterns. When there is density of clicks between these main patterns, it is often an indicator of a fraudulent publisher.
Website content can be adjusted to make it specific to users using “user navigational behavior” and user interests in a process called web personalization. Web personalization is useful in the realm of e-commerce. There are unique steps in the process of web personalization, and the first step is noted as “user profiling.” In this step, the user is understood and constituted through their click behavior, preferences, and qualities. Following user profiling is “log analysis and web usage mining.”


=== Email ===
Phishing is usually administered through emails, and when a user clicks on a phishing attempt email, their information will be leaked to particular websites. Spear-phishing is a more “targeted” form of phishing in which user information is used to personalize emails and entice users to click. Some phishing emails will also contain other links and attachments. Once these are either clicked or downloaded, users’ privacy can be encroached. Lin et al. conducted a study to see which psychological “weapons of influence” and “life domains” affect users most in phishing attempts, and they found that scarcity was the most influential factor weapon of influence, and the legal domain was the most influential life domain. Age is also an important factor in determining those who are more susceptible to clicking on phishing attempts.
When a virus infects a computer, it finds email addresses and sends copies of itself through these emails. These emails will usually contain an attachment and will be sent to several individuals. This differs from user email account behavior because users tend to have a particular network they communicate with regularly. Researchers studied how the Email Mining Toolkit (EMT) could be used to detect viruses by studying such user email account behavior and found that it was easier to decipher quick, broad viral propagations in comparison to slow, gradual viral propagations.
In order to know what emails users have opened, email senders engage in email tracking. By merely opening an email, users' email addresses can be leaked to third parties, and if users click on links within the emails, their email address can get leaked to a larger number of third parties. Also, each time a user opens an email sent to them, their information can get sent to a new third party among those that their address has already been leaked to. Many third party email trackers are also involved in web tracking, leading to further user profiling.


=== Privacy ===

Privacy-protection models anonymize data after it is sent to a server and stored in a database. Hence, user personal identification information is still collected, and this collection process is based on users trusting such servers. Researchers study giving users control over what information is sent from their mobile devices. They also observe giving users control over how that information is represented in databases in the realm of trajectory data, and they create a system that allows for this approach. This approach gives users the potential to increase their privacy.
When user privacy is going to be encroached, consent forms are often distributed. The type of user activity required in these forms can have an effect on how much information a user retains from the form. Karegar et al. compares the simple agree/disagree format with forms that incorporate checkboxes, drag and drop (DAD), and swipe features. When testing what information users would agree to disclose with each of the consent form formats, researchers observed that users presented with DAD forms had a greater number of eye-fixations and on the given consent form.
When a third-party is associated with a first-party website or mobile application, anytime a user visits the first party website or mobile application, their information will be sent to the third-party. Third-party tracking generates more privacy concerns than first-party tracking because it allows for many website or application records about a particular user to be combined, yielding better user profiles. Binns et al. found that among 5000 popular websites, the top two websites alone had 2000 trackers. Of the 2000 embedded trackers, 253 were used in 25 other websites. Researchers evaluated the reach of third-party trackers based on their contact with users rather than websites, so more ""popular"" trackers were those who received information about the highest number of people rather than code embedded in the most first-parties. Google and Facebook were deemed as the first and second largest web trackers, and Google and Twitter were deemed as the first and second largest mobile trackers.

"Malvertising (a portmanteau of ""malicious software (malware) advertising"") is the use of online advertising to spread malware. It typically involves injecting malicious or malware-laden advertisements into legitimate online advertising networks and webpages. Because advertising content can be inserted into high-profile and reputable websites, malvertising provides malefactors an opportunity to push their attacks to web users who might not otherwise see the ads, due to firewalls, more safety precautions, or the like. Malvertising is ""attractive to attackers because they 'can be easily spread across a large number of legitimate websites without directly compromising those websites'.""
Malvertising can be extremely hard to combat because it can quietly work its way into a webpage or webpage advertisement and spread unknowingly: ""The interesting thing about infections delivered through malvertising is that it does not require any user action (like clicking) to compromise the system and it does not exploit any vulnerabilities on the website or the server it is hosted from... infections delivered through malvertising silently travel through Web page advertisements."" It is able to expose millions of users to malware, even the most cautious, and is growing rapidly: ""In 2012, it was estimated nearly 10 billion ad impressions were compromised by malvertising."" Attackers have a very wide reach and are able to deliver these attacks easily through advertisement networks. Companies and websites have had difficulty diminishing the number of malvertising attacks, which ""suggests that this attack vector isn’t likely to disappear soon.""


== Overview ==
When websites or web publishers unknowingly incorporate corrupted or malicious advertisements into their page, computers can become infected pre-click and post-click. It is a misconception that infection only happens when visitors begin clicking on a malvertisement. ""Examples of pre-click malware include being embedded in main scripts of the page or drive-by-downloads. Malware can also auto-run, as in the case of auto redirects, where the user is automatically taken to a different site (without user interaction, such as clicking on them), which could be malicious. Malware can also be found in the delivery of an ad – where a clean ad that has no malware pre- or post-click (in its build and design) can still be infected whilst being called. Malicious code can hide undetected and the user has no idea what's coming their way. A post-click malvertisement example: ""the user clicks on the ad to visit the advertised site, and instead is directly infected or redirected to a malicious site. These sites trick users into copying viruses or spyware usually disguised as Flash files, which are very popular on the web."" Redirection is often built into online advertising, and this spread of malware is often successful because users expect a redirection to happen when clicking on an advertisement. A redirection that is taking place only needs to be co-opted in order to infect a user's computer.
Malvertising affects every part of the digital advertising chain differently. From platforms to publishers, and all the way down to the end-user who may have been the victim of a malvertising attack, everyone is affected. Malvertising often involves the exploitation of trustworthy companies. Those attempting to spread malware place ""clean"" advertisements on trustworthy sites first in order to gain a good reputation, then they later ""insert a virus or spyware in the code behind the ad, and after a mass virus infection is produced, they remove the virus"", thus infecting all visitors of the site during that time period. The identities of those responsible are often hard to trace, making it hard to prevent the attacks or stop them altogether, because the ""ad network infrastructure is very complex with many linked connections between ads and click-through destinations.""
Some malvertisements can infect a vulnerable computer even if the user never clicks on the (normal-appearing) advertisement.


== History ==
The first recorded sightings of malvertising were in late 2007 and early 2008. The threat was based on a vulnerability in Adobe Flash (something that has continued into the late 2010s) and affected a number of platforms including MySpace, Excite and Rhapsody. In 2009, the online edition of The New York Times Magazine was found to be serving an ad that was part of a larger click fraud scam that created a botnet network of malware-infected computers, nicknamed the Bahama botnet, that then went on to be used to carry out click fraud on pay per click ads all over the web. The banner feed of The New York Times was hacked for the weekend of September 11 to 14, causing some readers to see advertisements telling them their systems were infected and trying to trick them into installing rogue security software on their computers. According to spokeswoman Diane McNulty, ""The culprit approached the newspaper as a national advertiser and had provided apparently legitimate ads for a week"", and the ads were switched to the virus alert malvertisement afterwards. The New York Times then suspended third-party advertisements to address the problem, and even posted advice for readers regarding this issue on its technology blog.
In 2010, malvertising took off. Marketing analysts ClickZ noted that the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) identified billions of display ads, across 3500 sites carrying malware. In the same year the Online Trust Alliance formed a cross industry Anti-Malvertising Task Force. In 2011, Spotify had a malvertising attack which used the Blackhole exploit kit – this was one of the first instances of a drive-by download, where a user does not even have to click on an ad to become infected with malware. Symantec added malvertising as a section in their Internet Security Threat Report 2013 in 2012. Symantec used scanning software across a series of websites and detected that half of them were infected with malvertising. In 2012, the Los Angeles Times was hit by a massive malvertising attack which used the Blackhole exploit kit to infect users. It was seen as part of a general campaign of malvertising to hit large news portals – this strategy carried on into subsequent years with attacks on huffingtonpost.com and The New York Times. The growing intensity of malvertising continued in 2013, when a major malvertising campaign was waged against Yahoo.com, one of the largest ad platforms with monthly visits of 6.9 billion. The malware exploit was based on the commonly used web attack, Cross-site scripting (XSS), number three in the top ten web attacks types identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). The attack infected users' machines with the ransomware Cryptowall, a type of malware that extorts money from users by encrypting their data and placing a ransom of up to $1000 in bitcoins, to be paid in seven days, to decrypt the data. In 2014, there were major malvertising campaigns on the DoubleClick and Zedo ad networks. Various news portals, including The Times of Israel and the Hindustan Times, were affected. As in previous attacks the cybercrime involved Cryptowall as the malware infection. This spate of malvertising was believed to have brought over $1 million of ransom money in by infecting over 600,000 computers.
According to McAfee's February 2015 Threat Report, malvertising was beginning to grow quickly on mobile platforms in late 2014 and early 2015. Additionally, in 2015, there were malvertising campaigns on eBay, Answers.com, talktalk.co.uk, and wowhead.com, among others. The campaigns involved breaches of ad networks, including DoubleClick and engage:BDR. There was also a report of possibly the first ""political malvertising"" campaign by pro-Russian activists, which was based on a botnet, which then forced users' machines to visit bogus sites that generated ad revenue for the activists. The users also ended up at several pro-Russian propaganda videos.
In 2021, ransomware gang REvil was spotted using paid positioning in Google search results to deliver malicious files to victims. Malvertising cash or cryptocurrency giveaway campaigns with actors masquerading as popular figures including YouTuber MrBeast, Elon Musk, and others have been seen across many advertising platforms and social media sites. In 2022, reports surfaced of Native advertising on google search masquerading to be various software download pages (oftentimes open source), leading users to instead download ransomware, info stealer, or redirect them to tech support scams


== More examples of malicious advertisements ==
Several popular websites and news sources have been victims to malvertising and have had malicious advertisements placed on their webpages or widgets unknowingly, including Horoscope.com, The New York Times, the London Stock Exchange, Spotify, and The Onion.


== Types and modes ==
By visiting websites that are affected by malvertising, users are at risk of infection. There are many different methods used for injecting malicious advertisements or programs into webpages:

Pop-up ads for deceptive downloads, such as fake anti-virus programs that install malicious software on the computer
In-text or in-content advertising can have text adjusted to include malicious hyperlinks associated with content
Drive-by downloads is the activity of downloading a malicious file without a users consent as they visit a website
Web widgets in which redirection can be co-opted into redirecting to a malicious site
Hidden iframes that spread malware
Content delivery networks exploited to share malware
Malicious banners on websites
Third-party advertisements on webpages
Third-party applications, such as forums, help desks, and customer relationship management and content management systems
Mobile advertising through SMS promotions


=== Preventive measures ===
There are several precautions that people can take to reduce their chances of getting tricked by these advertisements. Commonly used programs such as Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Reader can and have had their flaws exploited, and become vulnerable to attacks, so it should no longer be used. Users can also download anti-virus software that protects against threats and removes malicious software from their systems. Users can also push companies and websites to scan advertisements before making them active on their webpages. Users can also use ad blocking software to avoid downloading the malware contained in advertisements or a specific browser extension alerting malvertising campaigns.
